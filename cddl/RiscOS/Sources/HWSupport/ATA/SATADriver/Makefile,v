@Switch to using OS_Memory 19 by default
Detail:
  Makefile - Now that OS_Memory 19 has been merged to the trunk version of the kernel (along with the other SMP changes, which might cause problems if OS_Memory 0 was to continued to be used), we can change our build setting to use OS_Memory 19 by default
Admin:
  Untested
  Requires Kernel-6_09

@Add support for using OS_Memory 19 for DMA prep
Detail:
  Makefile - Add OSMEM19 option to control whether OS_Memory 0 or OS_Memory 19 is used. Defaults to OS_Memory 0, since OS_Memory 19 is currently only available on the SMP kernel branch.
  c/op, c/osmem0, h/dmaprep - Move OS_Memory 0 related code out into its own file, creating the dmaprep interface to abstract over whether OS_Memory 0 or OS_Memory 19 is in use
  c/osmem19, cmhg/SATADriverHdr - Code for performing DMA prep using OS_Memory 19
  h/globals - Adjust what variables ahciop_t stores, depending on DMA prep approach being used
Admin:
  Tested on IGEPv5
  OS_Memory 19 version (for use with SMP kernel/module) can be enabled via components file, e.g. '-options OSMEM19=TRUE'

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of SATADriver module
Detail:
  This is the SATA implementation of a new generic ATA driver API, analogous
  to the SCSIDriver and SDIODriver APIs, but for ATA buses. Full support for
  port multipliers is included; effectively they appear transparent to the
  upper layers of the stack. No effort is to made to support enclosures,
  external SATA or hot-plugging (but note that hot-plugging is precluded by
  hardware on OMAP5432x and AM572x). Background transfers are only partially
  implemented at present. DMA is used, as mandated by the AHCI specification.
  The module is written mostly in C for maintainability and extendability, and
  uses locks for compatibility with a future multi-core version of the OS.
Admin:
  This version is what appeared in initial Titanium ROM releases.
