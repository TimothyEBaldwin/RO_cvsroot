log
@Drop StoreInHAL switch
No longer support or maintain the code which opened riscos.img and wrote values into it on the Pi.
However, carry over the logic which attempts to restore the time from the timestamp of the CMOS file from last shutdown so that the time (on a clockless Pi) is a better guess than the Unix epoch until the network time can be read.

Tested on a Pi 3.

1.1
log
@  Added support for writing fake CMOS on Raspberry Pi
Detail:
  For the Raspberry Pi, the CMOS RAM is embedded within the ROM image, since
  the default bootloader isn't flexible enough to load it from a separate
  file (and we need to know CMOS contents before modules like SDFS have
  initialised). This functionality is enabled by the build switch StoreInHAL
  passed in via the Makefile. Unrelatedly, removed a double free of the module
  workspace on finalisation.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi.
