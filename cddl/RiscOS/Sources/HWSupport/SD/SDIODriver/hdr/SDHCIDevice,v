@  Add Raspberry Pi Compute module support
Detail:
  This is the first board supported by RISC OS that has an eMMC chip. This
  is a non-removable flash memory device which obeys a recent revision of
  the MMC bus protocol, which has many similarities with the SD bus.
  * Flags added to low-level and high-level APIs to identify the device as
    a hard drive under SDFS (affects the media search algorithms).
  * For a sector-addressed MMC device (over 2 GB), CMD1 needs HCS set in
    the command or it won't respond.
  * The MMC device needed to be selected when reading the EXT_CSD (which is
    only present in sector-addressed MMC cards).
  * Added the generic SDHCI fallback versions of some HAL device routines.
Admin:
  Tested on a Compute module (of course).

@  Miscellaneous improvements
Detail:
  * Important data loss bug rectified: the retry mechanism inadvertently
    failed to pass back over data that had been transmitted to the card but
    not written successfully, instead picking up afterwards and swallowing
    the error. Therefore, only repeatable errors such as card timeouts were
    being reported correctly, and user data could be lost with no indication
    until it failed to read back correctly.
  * Supports controllers with the following quirks:
    1) Error bit in interrupt status register not implemented
    2) Non-standard method of triggering SD bus command
  * Reports non-standard error number 12 reported by some controllers
  * Checks for a major version match on SDHCI HAL devices before using them
    (should have been doing this all along, but fortunately there are no
    plans for incompatible changes that would force a major version change
    in the forseeable future).

@  Support the Raspberry Pi model B+
Detail:
  For removable slots without a card detect pin, disable the ticker routine
  to poll for the card-detect state, because the HAL is unable to report
  any meaningful result. Pass through the fact that it is one of these types
  of slots to SDFS, where card removal / change is detected by use of
  timeouts instead.
Admin:
  Already in use in RC12a.
