log
@  Added support for SD on OMAP4
Detail:
  The OMAP4 SD controller is more fussy about how it is reset than the OMAP3
  and BCM2835 controllers - more details in inline comments. Issue identified
  by Willi Theiss, but I have implemented the fix differently. Also added
  Willi's support for DebugLib debugging.
Admin:
  Tested on Beagleboard, Raspberry Pi and Pandaboard, and with the usual
  set of 30+ cards.

Version 0.04. Tagged as 'SDIODriver-0_04'
