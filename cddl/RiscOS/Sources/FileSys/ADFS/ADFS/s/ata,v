@  Initial import of ADFS 4
Detail:
  Version 4 of ADFS is a complete rewrite, but backward compatible with
  previous versions of ADFS. The hardware driver components have been
  extracted out into separate modules, along the lines of the
  SCSIFS/SCSIDriver and SDFS/SDIODriver interfaces. Initially, the only
  supported driver backend is for AHCI SATA controllers, but it is anticipated
  that PATA controller support and maybe even floppy drive support may be
  added at a later date to cater for legacy hardware. Background transfers are
  only partially implemented at present.
Admin:
  This version is what appeared in initial Titanium ROM releases.
