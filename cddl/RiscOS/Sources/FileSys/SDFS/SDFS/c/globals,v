@  Add Raspberry Pi Compute module support
Detail:
  The eMMC chip on the Compute module is now treated as a hard drive by SDFS.
  A number of bugs (relating to top-bit-set disc addresses for example) were
  required to facilitate this. If a board has an eMMC chip, then the default
  SDFS drive is drive 4 rather than drive 0; this doesn't require any change
  to the default CMOS values in the kernel or HAL (SDFS adjusts its
  interpretation of the CMOS byte instead).
Admin:
  Tested on a Compute module (of course).

Version 0.07. Tagged as 'SDFS-0_07'
