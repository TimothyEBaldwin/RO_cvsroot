@  Support the Raspberry Pi model B+
Detail:
  For removable slots without a card detect pin, use an alternate state
  machine based upon timeouts to detect card removal or card changes. Note
  that this requires cooperation from FileCore (the same code paths as with
  selected floppy drives that had faulty disc changed pins) to avoid data
  loss by assuming that a disc might need remounting if a certain time has
  elapsed since the last successful operation. To avoid a significant speed
  penalty from deselecting and reselecting cards, remounting isn't used for
  rapid back-to-back operations.
Admin:
  Already in use in RC12a.
