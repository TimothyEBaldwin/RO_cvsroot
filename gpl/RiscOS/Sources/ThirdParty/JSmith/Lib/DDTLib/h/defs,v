@Summary:                        
  Initial import of DDTLib library into CVS.
                                
Detail:                         
  This is Julian Smith's library to extract debug information from executables,
  required by his Trace library.                      
  The build system for the main library has been restructured not to use
  Makatic.
  There may be binary-only copies of this library floating around under the
  name 'DDT', but I've taken the liberty of renaming the library DDTLib to
  avoid possible confusion with the DDT module.
                                
Admin:                          
  all, clean, and export phases tested.
  Tested using the ATM driver, which uses DebugLib, which uses Trace, which
  uses DDTLib; appears to work as previous binary-only version did.
