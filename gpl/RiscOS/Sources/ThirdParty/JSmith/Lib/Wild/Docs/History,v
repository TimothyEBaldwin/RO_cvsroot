Added Wild_ScanPath3 - copes with multiple space-separated specs, and
multiple excludes.


08 Jul 1996

Now copes with search strings like '...*' (Adds '@@.' for searching, and
removes when calling function).

14 Aug 1996

Added Replace

Altered Replace to remove any instances of '..'


15 Aug 1996

Added Wild_PathMatches2, Wild_PathMatches3, Wild_PathMatches4.
Wild_PathMatches4 uses PlainArgv_StrTok.

Changed rest of Wild to use PlainArgv_StrTok instead of Utils - Utils
version uses DeskLib.

09 Sep 1996

*<n> now includes the trailing '.'. Removed removal of '..'.

22 Sep 1997

Now calls Desk_Filing_ScanDir2(), with flag to ignore errors when
reading dir contents. Allows read-protected directories to be ignored.


10 Nov 1997

Only checks whether path is a directory if path!=''.
Desk_File_IsDirectory( "") raises error about default filing ssytem
needing a filename or something.


18 Dec 1997

Adding support for removing a suffix from a filename.
#/<digit> treats '/' as a separator as well as '.'.

@Summary:                        
  Initial import of Wild library into CVS.
                                
Detail:                         
  This is Julian Smith's wildcard matching library, required by his Trace
  library.                      
  The build system for the main library has been restructured not to use
  Makatic, but the tests still do.
                                
Admin:                          
  all, clean, and export phases tested.
  Tested using the ATM driver, which uses DebugLib, which uses Trace, which
  uses Wild; appears to work as previous binary-only version did.
