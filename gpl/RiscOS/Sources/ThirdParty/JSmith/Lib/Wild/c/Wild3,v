@Summary:                        
  Initial import of Wild library into CVS.
                                
Detail:                         
  This is Julian Smith's wildcard matching library, required by his Trace
  library.                      
  The build system for the main library has been restructured not to use
  Makatic, but the tests still do.
                                
Admin:                          
  all, clean, and export phases tested.
  Tested using the ATM driver, which uses DebugLib, which uses Trace, which
  uses Wild; appears to work as previous binary-only version did.
