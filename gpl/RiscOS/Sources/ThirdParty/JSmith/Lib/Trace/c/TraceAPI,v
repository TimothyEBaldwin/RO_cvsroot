1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Flattened out the sources into one 'c' and 'h' directory, while a cunning VPATH allowed the code to be compiled in situ, the link step failed because of the way the object file names are generated.
Code now uses Unix style directory referenced, rather than ^.

Version 0.12. Tagged as 'Trace-0_12'
