@Makefile recreated from fragments
Flattened out the sources into one 'c' and 'h' directory, while a cunning VPATH allowed the code to be compiled in situ, the link step failed because of the way the object file names are generated.
Code now uses Unix style directory referenced, rather than ^.

Version 0.12. Tagged as 'Trace-0_12'

@Summary:                        
  Initial import of Trace library into CVS.
                                
Detail:                         
  This is Julian Smith's library to automatically trace function execution.
  The build system for the main library has been restructured not to use
  Makatic, but the tests still do.
  The slightly over-the-top-for-something-this-small hierarchy of source code
  has been retained to avoid too much reorganisation, but the 'root' of this
  hierarchy has been moved up to where you'd expect to find it, not buried deep
  within places usually used for object code.
                                
Admin:                          
  all, clean, and export phases tested.
  Tested using the ATM driver, which uses DebugLib, which uses Trace.  Appears
  to work as previous binary-only version did.
