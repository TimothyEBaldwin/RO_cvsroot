1.1
log
@  Update of defmod to the one that accompanies public version 6.21
  UNIX version.
Detail:
  This source set represents that distributed with OSLib 6.21.  I've
    fixed some faults and passed them back to the maintainers (notably
    an uncaught NULL pointer dereference in the chelp_output function).
  This application now builds on Solaris, Linux & FreeBSD.
  The bootstrap code moves to directory 'oslib' instead of 'bs' to avoid
    needing to change lots of includes between RISC OS and non-RISC OS
    variants.
Notes:
  -cstrong seems to produce empty files (on all variants) - I guess it's
    not supported any more (we don't need it either).
Admin:
  Tested on Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD and RISC OS.
  Sources re-released to maintainers as required under GPL licence.


Version 6.21. Tagged as 'defmod-6_21'
