1.2
log
@  Update of defmod to the one that accompanies public version 6.21
  UNIX version.
Detail:
  This source set represents that distributed with OSLib 6.21.  I've
    fixed some faults and passed them back to the maintainers (notably
    an uncaught NULL pointer dereference in the chelp_output function).
  This application now builds on Solaris, Linux & FreeBSD.
  The bootstrap code moves to directory 'oslib' instead of 'bs' to avoid
    needing to change lots of includes between RISC OS and non-RISC OS
    variants.
Notes:
  -cstrong seems to produce empty files (on all variants) - I guess it's
    not supported any more (we don't need it either).
Admin:
  Tested on Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD and RISC OS.
  Sources re-released to maintainers as required under GPL licence.


Version 6.21. Tagged as 'defmod-6_21'

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of the sources of the "defmod" tool, used to build OSLib.
  These sources represent the GPLed version of defmod available with OSLib
  5.5, with modifications to support -26bit and -32bit options to choose the
  APCS variant being used.
   
Detail:
  The code has been reorganised to remove dependencies on path variables
  which are not appropriate for our build structure.  The sources directory
  contains the main code sources; the bs directory contains bootstrap headers
  to enable defmod to be build without OSLib headers being available; the
  support directory contains derivatives of JCoxhead's support library.
  
  Code changes are a switch in support.s.riscosa to support 32-bit builds of
  defmod itself; sources.y.defmod includes VersionNum and uses Module_Date
  and Module_FullVersion in the -help output; sources.c.objasm has a new
  apcs32 flag which controls MOV vs. MOVS and LDM vs. LDM^ for veneer exits.
   
  The Makefile is a complete rewrite.
  
  Do not define __GNUC__ as zero even if the compiler wants you to - it
    breaks other things (due to inconsistent use of #ifdef and #if)
 
Admin:
  Checked output is correct by inspecting AOF files generated by ToolAction.
  This tool sits in the GNU sources directory as it is released the GPL.
  This tool exports its binary to the Library.Build directory because that
    is where it lives in the library at the moment.
