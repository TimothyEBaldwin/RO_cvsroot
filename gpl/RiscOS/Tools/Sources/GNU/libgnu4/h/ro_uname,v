@Initial import of GCC 4 compatible version of libgnu
Detail:
  This is a copy of our libgnu library, modified to work with GCC 4.
  Only the files necessary for building the current GCC-based tools have been ported over. Unused files have been left out, and where possible code now relies on functionality provided by the official UnixLib rather than libgnu.
Admin:
  Tested with rebuild of GCC-based tools (diff, gawk, grep, sed, textutils) followed by ROM + disc image builds using those tools
  Requires GCC4-based BuildHost environment


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'libgnu4-0_01'

#ifndef __ro_uname_h
#define __ro_uname_h

const char *ro_tounix (const char *filename, const char *exts_string);
/* Munge |filename| into Unix format, normally for output purposes.

   If |exts_string| == NULL, then just return |filename|.

   |exts_string| specifies which filename extensions are to be recognised. It
   has the format "ext[:ext]*", eg. "c:h:s":
	"lib.c.ro_uname" -> "lib/ro_uname.c"
	"lib.h.ro_uname" -> "lib/ro_uname.h"
	"lib.o.libgnu"   -> "lib/o/libgnu"
   Extensions are not restricted to single characters.

   Alternatively, |exts_string| may begin with '$', in which case what
   follows is assumed to be the name of an environment variable from which to
   read the extensions list; if the name is null, then "<program>$Exts" is
   used. (<program>'s leafname is read from |extern const char
   *program_name|.)

   If alterations are necessary, then the munged name is returned in an
   internal buffer which may be reallocated and reused in a subsequent call
   to ro_tounix().

   If no alterations are necessary, then |filename|+x will be returned.
   x is set such that any leading filing system prefix and drive name will
   have been stripped, along with any leading special directory identifier.

   If you want to preserve the string, you must copy it.
