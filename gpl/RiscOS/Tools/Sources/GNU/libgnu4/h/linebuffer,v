@Initial import of GCC 4 compatible version of libgnu
Detail:
  This is a copy of our libgnu library, modified to work with GCC 4.
  Only the files necessary for building the current GCC-based tools have been ported over. Unused files have been left out, and where possible code now relies on functionality provided by the official UnixLib rather than libgnu.
Admin:
  Tested with rebuild of GCC-based tools (diff, gawk, grep, sed, textutils) followed by ROM + disc image builds using those tools
  Requires GCC4-based BuildHost environment


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'libgnu4-0_01'
