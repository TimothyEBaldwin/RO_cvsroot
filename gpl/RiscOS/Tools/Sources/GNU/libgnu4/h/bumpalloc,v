@Initial import of GCC 4 compatible version of libgnu
Detail:
  This is a copy of our libgnu library, modified to work with GCC 4.
  Only the files necessary for building the current GCC-based tools have been ported over. Unused files have been left out, and where possible code now relies on functionality provided by the official UnixLib rather than libgnu.
Admin:
  Tested with rebuild of GCC-based tools (diff, gawk, grep, sed, textutils) followed by ROM + disc image builds using those tools
  Requires GCC4-based BuildHost environment


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'libgnu4-0_01'

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| Bump the allocation of the array pointed to by TABLE whenever required.  |
| The table already has already COUNT elements in it, this macro ensure it |
| has enough space to accommodate at least one more element.  Space is	   |
| allocated (2 ^ EXPONENT) elements at a time.  Each element of the array  |
| is of type TYPE.							   |
`-------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* Routines `xmalloc' and `xrealloc' are called to do the actual memory
   management.  This implies that the program will abort with a "memory
   exhausted" error if any problem arise.

   To work correctly, at least EXPONENT and TYPE should always be the
   same for all uses of this macro for any given TABLE.  A secure way to
   achieve this is to never use this macro directly, but use it to define
   other macros, which would then be TABLE-specific.

   The first time through, COUNT is usually zero.  Note that COUNT is not
   updated by this macro, but it should be update elsewhere, later.  This
   is convenient, because it allows TABLE[COUNT] to refer to the new
   element at the end.  Once its construction is completed, COUNT++ will
   record it in the table.  Calling this macro several times in a row
   without updating COUNT is a bad thing to do.  */

/* In cases `sizeof TYPE' would not always yield the correct value for
   the size of each element entry, this macro accepts a supplementary
   SIZE argument.  The EXPONENT, TYPE and SIZE parameters should still
   have the same value for all macro calls related to a specific TABLE.  */
