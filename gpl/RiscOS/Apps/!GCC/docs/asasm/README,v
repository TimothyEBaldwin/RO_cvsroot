@             README for 'asasm', formally known as 'as'
             ------------------------------------------

'asasm' started as a 'simple assembler' and was written by Niklas Röjemo under
the name 'as' and !AS in its Desktop version.  A non desktop version was
created for an Unix port by Andy Duplain and used in that form as backend
assembler in the GCC/GNAT Ada RISC OS ports.

Over time missing features like macro support were added and the emulation of
Acorn objasm's behavior was improved.

In 2005 the 'asasm' ('as') license changed to GPL v2 after kind permission of
Niklas Röjemo.

Currently 'asasm'/'as' is part of GCCSDK project (http://gccsdk.riscos.info/)
and its development continues there. After David Marston contribution, ELF
output is now possible allowing objasm compatible assembler files to be used
by GCCSDK 4 which is purely ELF and no longer AOF based like GCCSDK 3.

Over time there were various contributors (cfr. ChangeLog for more detail):

  - Niklas Röjemo: main author.
  - Andy Duplain: Unix port.
  - Nick Burrett, Simon Callan, Peter J. Burwood: various improvements needed
    for their GCC/GNAT Ada RISC OS ports
  - Darren Salt: macro support.
  - David Marston: ELF output.
  - John Tytgat: Two pass support, objasm compatibility improvements.
  - Timothy Baldwin, John-Mark Bell, Jeffrey Lee, Christopher Martin,
    Peter Naulls, Lee Noar, Tony van der Hoff, ...

Following persons helped testing and improving the v2.00 release by building
ROOL RISC OS IOMD, IYONIX and OMAP3 branches:

  - Jeffrey Lee
  - Andreas Walter

Releases:

- v1.47 :
  - Part of GCCSDK GCC 4.1.1 Rel 2 release.
- v2.00 :
  - Part of GCCSDK GCC 4.1.2 Rel 1.
  - Assembling happens in two passes.
  - Hugely improved ObjAsm compatibility : macro's, conditional and repeated
    directives, include statements, local labels, etc.
    At the time of its release, ROOL RISC OS 5 ROM builds for IOMD and IYONIX
    branches could be done using asasm instead of objasm.  The OMAP3 branch
    needs NEON and SSAT support which hasn't been implemented yet.
  - Adoption of several new semantics found in ARM Compiler toolchain v5.0

Future development:

- NEON/VFP support.
- Rework of the relocation code.
- DWARF debugging info in ELF output.
- Thumb support.
- Better way to enable/disable info/warning messages.
