1.1
log
@  Clean reimport of GCC version 2.95.4.
Detail:
  Original log from 2003-12-10 reads:
  This version is suitable for use on 32-bit machines, and creates APCS-32
  code by default. It is currently marked as "experimental", although it does
  fix several bugs that we have encountered using the last "stable" release.
  This directory is equivalent to a merge of the distribution archives "cc1",
  "cc1plus", "gcc" and "gccdoc" from http://www.riscos.info/gcc/32bit.html
  with one change: a #include commented out in _G_config.h, since this prevents
  the use of the STL library unless you are linking with UnixLib.

/* Note, the buf and del buffers are declared statically in the tty struct.
   This is so that an exec'd process which shares the tty struct doesn't
   free something allocated by the parent process.  Such a call to free would
   confuse the memory allocation system since the buffer wouldn't have been
   allocated by that process but by the parent process.  We could check the
   address of the buffer against __lomem and __break, but we might aswell
   just live with the statically allocated memory compared to the extra code
   we would need to have.  Lazy, probably, but it works okay and only costs
   MAXTTY * MAX_INPUT * 2 (= 1024 bytes in current implementation).  */
