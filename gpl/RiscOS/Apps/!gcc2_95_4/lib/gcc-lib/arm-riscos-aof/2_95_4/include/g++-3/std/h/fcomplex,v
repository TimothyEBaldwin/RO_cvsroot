1.1
log
@  Clean reimport of GCC version 2.95.4.
Detail:
  Original log from 2003-12-10 reads:
  This version is suitable for use on 32-bit machines, and creates APCS-32
  code by default. It is currently marked as "experimental", although it does
  fix several bugs that we have encountered using the last "stable" release.
  This directory is equivalent to a merge of the distribution archives "cc1",
  "cc1plus", "gcc" and "gccdoc" from http://www.riscos.info/gcc/32bit.html
  with one change: a #include commented out in _G_config.h, since this prevents
  the use of the STL library unless you are linking with UnixLib.
