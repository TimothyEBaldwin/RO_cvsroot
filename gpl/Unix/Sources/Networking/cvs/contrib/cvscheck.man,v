.SH NAME
cvscheck \- identify files added, changed, or removed in a CVS working
directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvscheck
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is a housekeeping aid.  It should be run in a working
directory that has been checked out using CVS.  It identifies files
that have been added, changed, or removed in the working directory, but
not CVS
.BR commit ted.
It also determines whether the files have been CVS
.BR add ed
or CVS
.BR remove d.
For directories, this command determines only whether they have been
.BR add ed.
It operates in the current directory only.
.LP
This command provides information that is available using CVS
.B status
and CVS
.BR diff .
The advantage of
.B cvscheck
is that its output is very concise.  It saves you the strain (and
potential error) of interpreting the output of CVS
.B status
and
.BR diff .
.LP
See
.BR cvs (local)
or
.BR cvshelp (local)
for instructions on how to add or remove a file or directory in a
CVS-controlled package.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit status is 0 if no files have been added, changed, or removed
from the current directory.  Otherwise, the command returns a count of
the adds, changes, and deletes.
