# cvscheck - identify files added, changed, or removed

# This program should be run in a working directory that has been
# checked out using CVS.  It identifies files that have been added,
# changed, or removed in the working directory, but not "cvs
# committed".  It also determines whether the files have been "cvs
# added" or "cvs removed".  For directories, it is only practical to
# determine whether they have been added.
