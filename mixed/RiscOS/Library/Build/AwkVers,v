@New switch 'obeymode' to AwkVers
Strikingly similar to the 'descmode' switch, but inserts version numbers into obey files as comments.

@Update AwkVers to cope with Frontend 'Desc' files
Detail:
  Build/AwkVers - By passing 'descmode=1' on the command line, AwkVers will swap _Version with a 'version ...' entry suitable for use in Frontend 'Desc' files

@AwkVers using wrong token from VersionNum.
Should be using Module_ApplicationDate since it's used for messages files for applications.

@  New script for copying version numbers into apps
Detail:
  Change from James Lampard:
    Several components that build desktop apps have an awk script in their
    build directory, to copy the version number from the VersionNum file into
    their final Messages file.
    Many other desktop app components currently do nothing, and rely on their
    messages file/templates being changed manually.
    It would obviously be superior to have a single script that all
    components could use in a central location. This is that script.
  Also fixed the perl scripts so they use a standard shebang (#!/usr/bin/env
  perl) before rather than after the licence header, as this is a technical
  requirement of shebangs on some systems.

  Tested on RiscPC RO402, with modified ChangeFSI, Maestro & Alarm
