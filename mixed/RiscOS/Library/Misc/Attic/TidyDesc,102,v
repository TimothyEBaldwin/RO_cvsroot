log
@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.
Detail:
  * Build/aoftoc: Import of RISC OS binary of this previously internal tool
    used to embed ARM code fragments in generic executables. Allows
    harmonisation of the native and cross-compiling build processes for
    tools like cmhg and squeeze.
  * Build/InstRes: This is a new script to allow components' install and
    resources phases to be written in a platform-independent manner. Target
    Perl installations are the RISC OS port of Perl 5.001 (distributed by
    ROOL), and any Perl which internally uses Posix-style filespecs - this
    includes Cygwin, Linux and Mac OS X versions of Perl, as well as later
    RISC OS ports based on UnixLib.
  * Misc/TidyDesc: Modified to accept the ouput of the GCC preprocessor in
    addition to the Norcroft one. Also added support for backslash escaping
    so the preprocessor can be used for string substitution in a wider
    variety of of files.
Admin:
  Tested by building components on RISC OS and Linux, using Norcroft and GCC.

@  New script for copying version numbers into apps
Detail:
  Change from James Lampard:
    Several components that build desktop apps have an awk script in their
    build directory, to copy the version number from the VersionNum file into
    their final Messages file.
    Many other desktop app components currently do nothing, and rely on their
    messages file/templates being changed manually.
    It would obviously be superior to have a single script that all
    components could use in a central location. This is that script.
  Also fixed the perl scripts so they use a standard shebang (#!/usr/bin/env
  perl) before rather than after the licence header, as this is a technical
  requirement of shebangs on some systems.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC RO402, with modified ChangeFSI, Maestro & Alarm
