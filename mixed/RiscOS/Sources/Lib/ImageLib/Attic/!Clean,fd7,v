Echo Stripping Makefile dependencies...
StripDepnd Makefile
@


1.2
log
@  Dependencies stripped. Delete o and z directories. New function.
Detail:
  All cleaning-related TaskObey files run StripDepnd on the relevant
  Makefile now. The o and z directories are wiped for ImageLib, libjpeg
  and libpng since there are dirs rules to create them (previously the
  clean rules only wiped the contents). A new function, ImageLib_Version,
  returns the Module_HelpVersion string from VersionNum.
Admin:
  Tested improved clean rules and rebuilt from clean. Operation of
  ImageLib_Version not tested.

Version 0.02. Tagged as 'ImageLib-0_02'
