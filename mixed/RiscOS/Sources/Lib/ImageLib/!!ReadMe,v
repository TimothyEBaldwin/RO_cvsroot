@ImageLib 18/10/2007 - ReadMe
============================

ImageLib provides applications with image decoding and
rendering facilities. It includes ports of the open source
JPEG and PNG libraries described in more detail by files
inside the 'JPEG' and 'PNG' subdirectories.

Most files fall under the shared source licence, except
for everything inside 'JPEG.c', 'JPEG.h', 'PNG.c' and
'PNG.h', which have their own licence conditions described
using comments inside their respective component files.
There may also be pieces of related documentation that are
covered by the library licence.
