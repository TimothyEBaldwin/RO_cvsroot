@  Added zinflate.
Detail:
  Kevin had taken the zdeflate example code and modified it to form
  a zinflate utility, but it never made it into CVS.
Admin:
  Built both, compressed zdeflate.c and uncompressed it using the two
  utilities, output matched input.


Version 1.14. Tagged as 'zlib-1_14'
@
text
@The zdeflate utility creates a compressed file using the zlib stream
interface. Syntax:

  zdeflate <infile> <outfile>

To build, bung through CC linking to stubs and zlib only.

The zinflate utility does the same thing, only backwards.
