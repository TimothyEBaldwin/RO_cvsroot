@Update to zlib 1.2.5, plus modifications
Detail:
  zlib 1.2.5 update:
  - README, c/*, h/* - Updated to zlib 1.2.5
  - algorithm - Deleted; updated doc now in 'doc' folder
  - doc/* - Added docs for zlib 1.2.5
  Changes compared to the official zlib distribution:
  - h/zutil - Use OS_CODE of 0x0d for RISC OS, as decreed by rfc1952
  - c/gzlib, c/gzread, c/gzwrite, h/zconf, h/zlib - Reintroduced ability to use ISO file access functions instead of POSIX ones, to allow the library to be easily used with Norcroft. Added gzgetheader() and gzputheader() functions to allow easy read/write of gzip file headers via the gzip file interface
  Other changes:
  - Makefile - Makefile rewritten. Now supports building of two components: zlib for the main zlib libraries (in application, module and utility/relocatable forms), and zlibmodlib, a library that wraps the ZLib module SWIs to provide a drop-in replacement for static linking against zlib (only builds application & module configs)
  - c/modlib - Main zlibmodlib source
Admin:
  Main deflate/inflate code tested somewhat
  gzip code modifications and zlibmodlib currently untested


Version 1.19. Tagged as 'zlib-1_19'

@ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

zlib 1.2.5 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format)
and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@@gzip.org).  A usage example
of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library
is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file minigzip.c.  The
compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and
minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes
well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use one
of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use
make_vms.com.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant
<info@@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is
http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to
verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest
version and check whether the problem still exists or not.

PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html before asking for help.

Mark Nelson <markn@@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997
issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at
http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/ .

The changes made in version 1.2.5 are documented in the file ChangeLog.

Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .

zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/ .

A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmqs@@cpan.org> is available
at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including
http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/ .

A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@@amk.ca> is
available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see
http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html .

zlib is built into tcl: http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610 .

An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top
of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com>, is available in the
contrib/minizip directory of zlib.


Notes for some targets:

- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With
  -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
  compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
  when compiled with cc.

- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
  necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
  other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.

- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/


Acknowledgments:

  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and
  zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the
  people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they
  are too numerous to cite here.

- add -std1 option in configure for OSF1 to fix gzprintf (Martin Mokrejs)
- use default value of 4K for Z_BUFSIZE for 16-bit MSDOS (Tim Wegner + Glenn)
- added os2/Makefile.def and os2/zlib.def (Andrew Zabolotny)
- add shared lib support for UNIX_SV4.2MP (MATSUURA Takanori)

- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def, zlib.rc
  and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with -DZLIB_DLL
  The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti and is
  now maintained by Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com>. Check the zlib DLL
  home page at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll

  From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not take
  a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.
  See contrib/visual-basic.txt for more information.
  I don't know how to handle structures in Visual Basic, sorry.

  With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works
  with other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.

- For shared memory multiprocessors, the decompression code assumes that
  writes to pointers are atomic. Also the functions zalloc and zfree passed
  to deflateInit must be multi-threaded in this case.
