@readme.1st.

The files in the pr/tests/w16gui directory are taken
from "Programming Windows 3.1" by Charles Petzold,
specifically, the programs in chapter 14 related
to the "poppad4" sample application.

These programs are compiled with nspr20 to test nspr 2.0
and to demostrate the use of nspr in a gui application.

Library (DLL) PLDSxx.lib PLDSxx.dll is required to be
linked with this test case. Functions in this dll are
in the source ns/nspr20/lib/ds/plevent.* files.

Permission to use.

The source for poppad.c are used under license from
Petzold. The license to use is stated in the book.
The following paragraph of the license grants that
use.

 5. SAMPLE CODE.  If the SOFTWARE includes Sample Code, then
    Microsoft grants you a royalty-free right to reproduce and
    distribute the sample code of the SOFTWARE provided that you:
    (a) distribute the sample code only in conjunction with and
    as part of your software product; (b) do not use Microsoft's
    or its authors' names, logos, or trademarks to market your
    software product; (c) include the copyright notice that appears
    on the SOFTWARE on your product label and as a part of the
    sign-on message for your software product; and (d) agree to
    idemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft and its authors
    from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys'
    fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of
    your software product.

First attempt at a port of the NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime), with just
enough in it to support JavaScript. And it really is, this time...
