@NSPR 2.0 libc functions
-----------------------

Last edited: AOF 04 March 1997

This directory contains various libc-types of functions. All functions in
this directory are platform independent, thread friendly (both safe and
efficient). They are contributed from various sources, though the contri-
butions are monitored by the NSPR group (mailto:freier).

All API items exported by these functions will contain the same three
character prefix, "PL_" (Portable Library). Internal function names
that are not exported (static) are of little concern, though some caution
must be used on those elements that are 'extern' but not really intended
to be part of the API. Those should all have a prefix of "_PL_" (is that
legal?).

The responsibility for contributions in this area are distributed among
all interested parties.

First attempt at a port of the NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime), with just
enough in it to support JavaScript. And it really is, this time...
