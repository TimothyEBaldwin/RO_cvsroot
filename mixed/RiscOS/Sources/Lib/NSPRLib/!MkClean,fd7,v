1.2
log
@  Brought under srccommit control.
Detail:
  ROSallocs.h now defines rosallocs_version to get the local build
  version (as opposed to NSPRLib library version, not that such an
  entity specifically exists) from Module_HelpVersion in the VersionNum
  file. !MkClean uses the build tools StripDepnd so the BASIC one in
  Utils has been removed, along with the Utils directory itself since it
  is now empty.
Admin:
  Checked !MkClean still worked properly (it does) and rebuilt from
  clean. Operation of rosallocs_version not tested.

Version 0.01. Tagged as 'NSPRLib-0_01'

First attempt at a port of the NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime), with just
enough in it to support JavaScript. And it really is, this time...
