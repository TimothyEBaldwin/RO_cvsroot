1.2
log
@  Use standard StripDepnd. Alternate string GC function.
Detail:
  Utils.StripDepnd (old BASIC version) removed; standard build tools copy
  used instead. Core/c/jsstr holds a (commented out) alterative garbage
  collector function from a later version - not in use yet, just there as
  a placeholder. In the test directory, the test C file was a development
  version, presumably overwritten by accident at a previous check-in;
  this has been restored to one that runs 'script/js' once.
Admin:
  Made sure clean rules still stripped dependencies. Rebuilt from clean
  for export; stand-alone interpreter built and tested; compiled and ran
  test program.
