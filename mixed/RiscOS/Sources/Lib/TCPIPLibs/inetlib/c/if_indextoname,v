@Add support for RFC2553
Detail:
  headers/net/if.h: new defines, structs, prototypes per RFC2553.
  headers/netdb.h: new defines, structs, prototypes per RFC2553 (from FreeBSD revision 102227).
  headers/sys/socket.h: portability sockaddr_storage struct, extend list of PF_ and AF_ defines (from FreeBSD revision 102227).
  headers/netinet/in.h: new defines, structs, prototypes per RFC2553 (from FreeBSD in6.h revision 102227)
  inetlib/if_indextoname.c
          if_nameindex.c
          if_nametoindex.c: import of new interface functions (from FreeBSD revision 100138).
          in6addr.c: constant structs for in6addr_any and in6addr_loopback per RFC2553.
          getnainfo.c: import of new function (from FreeBSD revision 158790).
          getipnode.c: new (with hostentdup based on _hpcopy from FreeBSD revision 103335).
          getadinfo.c: new (with portions based on FreeBSD revision 103640).
  LibraryDoc: updated with summaries of the new functions in Inetlib.
Admin:
  Test harness in test/rfc2553.c exercises most of the new functionality.
  Submission for TCP/IP bounty.

Version 5.66. Tagged as 'TCPIPLibs-5_66'

 * The ifname argument must point to a buffer of at least IF_NAMESIZE

 * its value includes a terminating null byte at the end of the

 * index, NULL is returned, and errno is set to ENXIO, if there was a
 * system error (such as running out of memory), if_indextoname returns
 * NULL and errno would be set to the proper value (e.g., ENOMEM).
