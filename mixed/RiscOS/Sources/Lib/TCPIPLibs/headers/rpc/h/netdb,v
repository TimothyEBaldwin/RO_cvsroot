@  64-bit type support in RPC.
  Port discovery function now prototyped!
Detail:
  64-bit support has been added to XDR for any protocols that might
    need it (eg. NFS3)
  getrpcport now has a prototype (rpc/netdb.h)
Admin:
  Tested by building the NFS3 lower-level support files from the
    protocol definition file and verified that the rpcgen generated
    code would compile and link without error.
  This version represents issue 1 of 1215,201/DR and 1215,202/DR.
  This version (5.07) is associated with AMR 5201.

Version 5.07. Tagged as 'TCPIPLibs-5_07'

@  Prototypes upgraded to ANSI-style.  This is required so that C++ source code
    can include them (third party needs this)
  Removed duplicate headers from inside rpclib - now uses the exported headers
    which should avoid inconsistencies developing.
  No longer uses cc400 during builds.
Detail:
  Nearly every header is changed.  Parameter prototypes cross-checked against
    actual source code, Solaris 2.6 headers, and comments in the rpclib headers.
  Build improvement: no longer uses "cc400" to compile clnt_udp.c.  Previously
    this was done because newer compilers were alleged to generate broken code.
    The example quoted was the NFS module's free display.  The fault actually
    lies in the NFS module passing the wrong parameters to xdr_string!  Future
    builds of NFS will require TCPIPLibs-5_04 or later.
Admin:
  Built.  Tested by building NFS against it.  Verified free space display works
    properly (needs NFS 2.36).  Tested inclusion of all RPC headers from C++
    source file worked without warnings or errors.
