4.3
log
@  Prototypes upgraded to ANSI-style.  This is required so that C++ source code
    can include them (third party needs this)
  Removed duplicate headers from inside rpclib - now uses the exported headers
    which should avoid inconsistencies developing.
  No longer uses cc400 during builds.
Detail:
  Nearly every header is changed.  Parameter prototypes cross-checked against
    actual source code, Solaris 2.6 headers, and comments in the rpclib headers.
  Build improvement: no longer uses "cc400" to compile clnt_udp.c.  Previously
    this was done because newer compilers were alleged to generate broken code.
    The example quoted was the NFS module's free display.  The fault actually
    lies in the NFS module passing the wrong parameters to xdr_string!  Future
    builds of NFS will require TCPIPLibs-5_04 or later.
Admin:
  Built.  Tested by building NFS against it.  Verified free space display works
    properly (needs NFS 2.36).  Tested inclusion of all RPC headers from C++
    source file worked without warnings or errors.

Version 5.04. Tagged as 'TCPIPLibs-5_04'

 * The following procedures are supported by the protocol:
 *
 * PMAPPROC_NULL() returns ()
 * 	takes nothing, returns nothing
 *
 * PMAPPROC_SET(struct pmap) returns (bool_t)
 * 	TRUE is success, FALSE is failure.  Registers the tuple
 *	[prog, vers, prot, port].
 *
 * PMAPPROC_UNSET(struct pmap) returns (bool_t)
 *	TRUE is success, FALSE is failure.  Un-registers pair
 *	[prog, vers].  prot and port are ignored.
 *
 * PMAPPROC_GETPORT(struct pmap) returns (long unsigned).
 *	0 is failure.  Otherwise returns the port number where the pair
 *	[prog, vers] is registered.  It may lie!
 *
 * PMAPPROC_DUMP() RETURNS (struct pmaplist *)
 *
 * PMAPPROC_CALLIT(unsigned, unsigned, unsigned, string<>)
 * 	RETURNS (port, string<>);
 * usage: encapsulatedresults = PMAPPROC_CALLIT(prog, vers, proc, encapsulatedargs);
 * 	Calls the procedure on the local machine.  If it is not registered,
 *	this procedure is quite; ie it does not return error information!!!
 *	This procedure only is supported on rpc/udp and calls via
 *	rpc/udp.  This routine only passes null authentication parameters.
 *	This file has no interface to xdr routines for PMAPPROC_CALLIT.
 *
 * The service supports remote procedure calls on udp/ip or tcp/ip socket 111.
