1.2

@  ChangeFSI changes
Detail:
  Main ChangeFSI program changed to assemble new instructions on ROL OS
  versions without "No such mnemonic" error. Also changed to handle
  _Version: token in messages file.

  Added "stripdepnd Makefile" to !MkClean.

  Makefile locks destination !Sprites and !Sprites22 files, because
  everything else is being locked.

  Makefile altered to use new centalised awkscript to keep version numbers
  updated. (Note that ChangeFSI has a slightly odd makefile, so this
  shouldn't be used as an example of how to modify Makefiles to use the new
  awk version script.)

  Window menu fixed to be style guide compliant.
Admin:
  Requires Library 1.32
  Tested on RiscPC RO402
Notes:
  Changes by James Lampard.

Version 1.28. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_28'

1.1
log
@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'
