@  ChangeFSI changes
Detail:
  Main ChangeFSI program changed to assemble new instructions on ROL OS
  versions without "No such mnemonic" error. Also changed to handle
  _Version: token in messages file.

  Added "stripdepnd Makefile" to !MkClean.

  Makefile locks destination !Sprites and !Sprites22 files, because
  everything else is being locked.

  Makefile altered to use new centalised awkscript to keep version numbers
  updated. (Note that ChangeFSI has a slightly odd makefile, so this
  shouldn't be used as an example of how to modify Makefiles to use the new
  awk version script.)

  Window menu fixed to be style guide compliant.
Admin:
  Requires Library 1.32
  Tested on RiscPC RO402
Notes:
  Changes by James Lampard.

@                       ChangeFSI
                       =========

ChangeFSI is a useful program for converting and displaying image files of
various formats. These images can then be converted into sprites or JPEGs
for viewing with RISC OS applications such as !Paint and !Draw. (Note that
versions of !Paint and !Draw supplied with RISC OS 3.50 and earlier cannot
import JPEG files.)

You should make sure that your conversion and subsequent use of an image
does not infringe on any copyright that the image may be under.

More complete help on ChangeFSI is available from text files held within the
application. If you want to read these files, shift double-click on
!ChangeFSI to open the application directory, then open its Documents
directory and double-click on one of the text files:

File            Description
----            -----------
CmdBasUse       Syntax for using ChangeFSI from the command line, and for
                calling it from BASIC programs.

DesktopUse      Instructions for using ChangeFSI from the desktop.

Formats         Details of formats that ChangeFSI can use as input or
                output.

JPEGInfo        Standard information about JPEG processing (taken from the
                Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software).

BTPCinfo        Information on the BTPC file format

Theory          Theoretical explanation of how ChangeFSI works, likely only
                to be of interest to advanced users.

256sprites      Information for programmers about creating, recognising and
                displaying a sprite with a 256-entry palette.

4.2
log
@Added btpc 4.1 support,though the detection in the main program has
always been there the binary vanished sometime round 1995.
Added abridged info on BTPC to the appropriate docs,plus docs updates
to reflect interesting information which seems to have been
progressively removed with time.
Yucky sprites added,Sprites23 deleted.
The output window now remembers where it was last opened instead of
always jumping to the middle of the screen.
You no longer need to be in a specific screen depth for any operation,
before (particularly using special mode "r") it needed to read the
palette in a particular mode - now if it realises it cannot it will look
for a default palette in its Palettes directory and only then give an
error.
Reinstated 256 colour special mode "t",this has always been missing the
4096 colour lookup table and most of the support for it was removed in
about 1992 though the assembler remained leading to a "No such variable"
error when trying to use it.GenCFSIict produces the table.
