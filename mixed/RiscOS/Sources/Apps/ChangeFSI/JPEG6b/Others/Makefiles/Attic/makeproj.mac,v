-- This AppleScript builds Code Warrior PRO Release 2 project files for the
-- libjpeg library as well as the test programs 'cjpeg', 'djpeg', 'jpegtran'.
-- (We'd distribute real project files, except they're not text
-- and would create maintenance headaches.)
--
-- The script then compiles and links the library and the test programs.
-- NOTE: if you haven't already created a 'jconfig.h' file, the script
-- automatically copies 'jconfig.mac' to 'jconfig.h'.
--
-- To use this script, you must have AppleScript 1.1 or later installed
-- and a suitable AppleScript editor like Script Editor or Script Debugger
-- (http://www.latenightsw.com). Open this file with your AppleScript
-- editor and execute the "run" command to build the projects.
--
-- Thanks to Dan Sears and Don Agro for this script.
-- Questions about this script can be addressed to dogpark@@interlog.com

1.1
log
@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'
