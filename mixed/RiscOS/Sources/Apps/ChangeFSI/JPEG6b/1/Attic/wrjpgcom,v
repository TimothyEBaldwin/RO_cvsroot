@.TH WRJPGCOM 1 "15 June 1995"
.SH NAME
wrjpgcom \- insert text comments into a JPEG file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrjpgcom
[
.B \-replace
]
[
.BI \-comment " text"
]
[
.BI \-cfile " name"
]
[
.I filename
]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B wrjpgcom
reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named,
and generates a new JPEG/JFIF file on standard output.  A comment block is
added to the file.
.PP
The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.
Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they
are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings.  This lets you add
annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve
them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in the JPEG
file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of
them as you like in one JPEG file.
.PP
.B wrjpgcom
adds a COM block, containing text you provide, to a JPEG file.
Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any existing COM blocks; but you
can delete the old COM blocks if you wish.
.SH OPTIONS
Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not case sensitive.
.TP
.B \-replace
Delete any existing COM blocks from the file.
.TP
.BI \-comment " text"
Supply text for new COM block on command line.
.TP
.BI \-cfile " name"
Read text for new COM block from named file.
.PP
If you have only one line of comment text to add, you can provide it on the
command line with
.BR \-comment .
The comment text must be surrounded with quotes so that it is treated as a
single argument.  Longer comments can be read from a text file.
.PP
If you give neither
.B \-comment
nor
.BR \-cfile ,
then
.B wrjpgcom
will read the comment text from standard input.  (In this case an input image
file name MUST be supplied, so that the source JPEG file comes from somewhere
else.)  You can enter multiple lines, up to 64KB worth.  Type an end-of-file
indicator (usually control-D) to terminate the comment text entry.
.PP
.B wrjpgcom
will not add a COM block if the provided comment string is empty.  Therefore
\fB\-replace \-comment ""\fR can be used to delete all COM blocks from a file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Add a short comment to in.jpg, producing out.jpg:
.IP
.B wrjpgcom \-c
\fI"View of my back yard" in.jpg
.B >
.I out.jpg
.PP
Attach a long comment previously stored in comment.txt:
.IP
.B wrjpgcom
.I in.jpg
.B <
.I comment.txt
.B >
.I out.jpg
.PP
or equivalently
.IP
.B wrjpgcom
.B -cfile
.I comment.txt
.B <
.I in.jpg
.B >
.I out.jpg

1.1
log
@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'
