.SH NAME
rdjpgcom \- display text comments from a JPEG file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdjpgcom
[
.B \-verbose
]
[
.I filename
]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B rdjpgcom
reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named,
and prints any text comments found in the file on the standard output.
.PP
The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.
Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they
are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings.  This lets you add
annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve
them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in the JPEG
file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of
them as you like in one JPEG file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-verbose
Causes
.B rdjpgcom
to also display the JPEG image dimensions.
.PP
Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not case sensitive.
.SH HINTS
.B rdjpgcom
does not depend on the IJG JPEG library.  Its source code is intended as an
illustration of the minimum amount of code required to parse a JPEG file
header correctly.
.PP
In
.B \-verbose
mode,
.B rdjpgcom
will also attempt to print the contents of any "APP12" markers as text.
Some digital cameras produce APP12 markers containing useful textual
information.  If you like, you can modify the source code to print
other APPn marker types as well.

.BR djpeg (1),

1.1
log
@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'
