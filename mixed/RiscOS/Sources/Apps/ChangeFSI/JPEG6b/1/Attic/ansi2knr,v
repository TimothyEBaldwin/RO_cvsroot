@.TH ANSI2KNR 1 "19 Jan 1996"
.SH NAME
ansi2knr \- convert ANSI C to Kernighan & Ritchie C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I ansi2knr
[--varargs] input_file [output_file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If no output_file is supplied, output goes to stdout.
.br
There are no error messages.
.sp
.I ansi2knr
recognizes function definitions by seeing a non-keyword identifier at the left
margin, followed by a left parenthesis, with a right parenthesis as the last
character on the line, and with a left brace as the first token on the
following line (ignoring possible intervening comments).  It will recognize a
multi-line header provided that no intervening line ends with a left or right
brace or a semicolon.  These algorithms ignore whitespace and comments, except
that the function name must be the first thing on the line.
.sp
The following constructs will confuse it:
.br
     - Any other construct that starts at the left margin and follows the
above syntax (such as a macro or function call).
.br
     - Some macros that tinker with the syntax of the function header.
.sp
The --varargs switch is obsolete, and is recognized only for
backwards compatibility.  The present version of
.I ansi2knr
will always attempt to convert a ... argument to va_alist and va_dcl.
.SH AUTHOR
L. Peter Deutsch <ghost@@aladdin.com> wrote the original ansi2knr and
continues to maintain the current version; most of the code in the current
version is his work.  ansi2knr also includes contributions by Francois
Pinard <pinard@@iro.umontreal.ca> and Jim Avera <jima@@netcom.com>.

1.1
log
@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'
