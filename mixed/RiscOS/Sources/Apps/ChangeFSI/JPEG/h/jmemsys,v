@Import IJG8d sources
Detail:
  This is a clean import of the reference code from JPEG 8d. One of the terms of use is to be able to show the changes made to the reference copy, so this commit serves as that point.

 * Copyright (C) 1992-1997, Thomas G. Lane.
 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
 *
 * This include file defines the interface between the system-independent
 * and system-dependent portions of the JPEG memory manager.  No other
 * modules need include it.  (The system-independent portion is jmemmgr.c;
 * there are several different versions of the system-dependent portion.)
 *
 * This file works as-is for the system-dependent memory managers supplied
 * in the IJG distribution.  You may need to modify it if you write a
 * custom memory manager.  If system-dependent changes are needed in
 * this file, the best method is to #ifdef them based on a configuration
 * symbol supplied in jconfig.h, as we have done with USE_MSDOS_MEMMGR
 * and USE_MAC_MEMMGR.

 * This routine computes the total space still available for allocation by

 *
 * There is a minimum space requirement, corresponding to the minimum
 * feasible buffer sizes; jmemmgr.c will request that much space even if
 * jpeg_mem_available returns zero.  The maximum space needed, enough to hold
 * all working storage in memory, is also passed in case it is useful.
 * Finally, the total space already allocated is passed.  If no better
 * method is available, cinfo->mem->max_memory_to_use - already_allocated
 * is often a suitable calculation.
 *
 * It is OK for jpeg_mem_available to underestimate the space available
 * (that'll just lead to more backing-store access than is really necessary).
 * However, an overestimate will lead to failure.  Hence it's wise to subtract
 * a slop factor from the true available space.  5% should be enough.
 *
 * On machines with lots of virtual memory, any large constant may be returned.
 * Conversely, zero may be returned to always use the minimum amount of memory.
