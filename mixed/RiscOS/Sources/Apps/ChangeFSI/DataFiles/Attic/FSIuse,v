@Lost the sources to 1.15 somewhere,and RISC OS 4 came with 1.17.
Output template reworked
Zoom template swiped from !Paint
Infobox and saveas box swiped from !Edit
Improved error messages for unsupported formats
Hyphenated the date (also now derived at build time from the VersionNum
file)
Assembler stamped on to remove 26 bit code (uses MRS and MSR,hence ARM6
or later,but the RMEnsure of Utility module catches this).
Rejigged a few ADRs which were no longer in range due to the above.
Added ChangeFSI alias to !Boot file,it's always been documented as being
available...
Took 6b of the IJG jpeg code,and updated the JPEGinfo file accordingly
3dtemplate renamed as Template3d
Eliminated some dead documentation which never went on the disc image
anyway
Bug fix for CLI use when output is an S16 sprite,no default x dpi or y dpi
was assumed leading to an infinitely narrow infinitely tall sprite.
REM'd out the sketchy support for S24,a mythical 24 bpp packed sprite and
tweaked the docs to read S32 which you can actually generate!
Now handles progressive JPEGs (merged from a patched CFSI from RComp's
webpages).
Adds TechnoI video digitiser reading (untested)
Adds P8 reading (untested)
Merged the useful bits from RISC OS Ltd's sources,which seem to be
pretty unchanged from V1.15.
 * Missing hpcdtoppm sources,so no 32 bit there
 * Missing btpc sources,so no 32 bit there

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_18'

@Use: ChangeFSI <in file> <out file> <mode>[cdtp] [<n>:<n> [<n>:<n>]] [options]
Changes source picture to output sprite in specified mode, with suffix:
c
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 4x4 cell
  2 bit modes: use the four colours "black", "cyan", "magenta" and "yellow"
d
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 2x2 cell
  4 bit modes: use 1 bit red, 1 bit green, 1 bit blue
  8 bit modes: 256 level grey scale
t
  1 bit modes: use clustered dithering with 3x3 cell
  4 bit modes: 16 level grey scale
r
  2 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
  4 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
  8 bit modes: Devious colour matching algorithm
-no suffix-
  1 bit modes: b/w dispersed dot dithering
  2 bit modes: 4 level grey scale
  4 bit modes: 8 level grey scale
  8 bit modes: John Bowler's colour matching algorithm
               (defaults to 'r' mode if not VIDC1 compatible)
(see FSIinfo for more information on suffix)
The pixel size is corrected for and the default is output of the same size as
the input. Size ratios are output:input or = for scale to output size.
Mode 'AIM' writes an AIM format output file.
Mode 'p15' writes a p15 file.
Modes 'p1' to 'p6' write PBM files.
Mode 'JPEG' writes a JPEG format output file.
-equal    performs histogram equalisation.
-hflip, -vflip    present the picture left/right reversed / upside down.
-rotate   +90 degree rotation of the image.
-rotate-  -90 degree rotation of the image.
-info     gives details of the source image.
-invert   inverts the colour range of the input image.
-noscale  disables automatic pixel size correction.
-nosize   disables automatic pixel size correction for input pixels only.
-range    expands the input's dynamic range to full scale.
-sharpen  digitally sharpens the picture, -sharpen<n> overrides the default
          of 24: range 8(harsh)-31(soft).
-brighten brightens the entire image (caution: may saturate hues to white)
-gamma    applies gamma correction, -gamma<n> overrides the default of 2.2
-nodither prevents the error diffusion dithering.
-black    corrects for black inked spots larger than square pixels, -black<n>
          overrides the default of 32: range 0(not at all)-128(harsh)
-red<r>, -green<r>, -blue<r> allow the red, green, blue weights for monochrome
          luminance to be changed from their CIE defaults of 0.299, 0.587, 0.114.
-max<n>   maximum size of output image before output to disc.
Modes S16 and S32 write 16 and 32 bit per pixel sprites, with X and Y pixels
per inch specified as comma seperated values (e.g. S16,90,90)
