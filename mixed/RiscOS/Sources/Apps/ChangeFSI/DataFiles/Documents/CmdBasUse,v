@Add 4k and 64k sprite output options
Update ChangeFSI's 16bpp output code paths to convert to 4k and 64k sprites (as well as the pre existing 32k RISC OS 3.5 style).
Also, simplify the sprite output dialogue a little by grouping the colours together and the DPI as an option, to halve the number of radio buttons.
If ChangeFSI is run on a kernel without 4k/64k support, those two depths are greyed out in the GUI (since after processing the desktop frontend expects to SpriteOp plot them), however at the command line the 2 new depths are always available (as S12 and S16).

ChangeFSI: Add the conversion code
DesktopFE: Rework dialogue with fewer radio icons, add fading logic

@============================================================================
                   ChangeFSI command line and BASIC usage
============================================================================


This file gives the command line syntax of ChangeFSI, details of options not
available from the desktop, and examples of use. It also tells you how to
use it as a BASIC library. Finally there is an important note about certain
system variables that must be set to ensure full functionality.

                -green<g>,      deriving monochrome luminance from their CIE
                -blue<b>        defaults of 0.299, 0.587 and 0.114

Use
---
You need to have booted the ChangeFSI application which sets up an alias for
the ChangeFSI command; and you must be running outside the desktop (e.g. by
pressing F12).

An hourglass is displayed giving the percentage processed; this may run
through twice for some of the more expensive options. The program reads the
source image from disc and builds the output in memory, having claimed some
from the system.

On machines where the OS is not shadowed in RAM, you can improve ChangeFSI's 
performance by first typing '*RMFaster BASIC'.

The -nomode option
------------------
The program selects mode 0 when doing any work in order to speed up
processing; you can disable this using -nomode.

The -max option
---------------
You can build very large output files strips at a time and send them
directly to disk using the parameter '-max'. For example:

  ChangeFSI <in> <out> 28 -max512K

will convert the file with a maximum of 512KBytes held in memory. Options 25t,
-rotate and -vflip don't work when this is being done.

The -red, -green and -blue options
----------------------------------
Conversion from colour to monochrome shades of grey is done with the CIE
luminance weights for red, green and blue (0.299, 0.587, 0.114), which is
the standard conversion for broadcast television. These values can be
altered using the -red, -green and -blue options, so you can try different
weightings for conversion to monochrome. This also allows you to separate
out some of the colours in making a black and white image (e.g. -red1
-green0 -blue0).

Other options
-------------
For details of other options, see the DesktopUse file's descriptions of the
equivalent desktop options.

Examples
--------
è Make "standard palette" versions of existing 256 colour images (for
  example the Watford digitiser plus colour board doesn't use the standard
  palette):

  changefsi in out 13p            for a coloured Watford picture

è Convert a colour picture to something you can see on a high resolution
  monochrome monitor:

  changefsi in out 18 -sharpen -info

è Convert a large monochrome picture (from a scanner, say) to something
  which can be seen:

  changefsi in out 20t 1:4 -gamma

è Convert a colour picture to grey scale for the desktop:

  changefsi in out 20

è Change a 512 by 480 image to standard format and aspect ratio:

  changefsi in out 15 640:512 512:480           or:
  changefsi in out = -range

è Change to digital r, g, b:

  changefsi in out 20d -sharpen16

è Convert a picture for printing on a 300dpi laser.

  changefsi in out 18c 300:90 -sharpen


Using ChangeFSI as a BASIC library
==================================

You can also load ChangeFSI as a BASIC function library from other BASIC
programs, thus:

  LIBRARY "<ChangeFSI$Dir>.ChangeFSI"

This gives a new function which provides the full command line functionality 
of ChangeFSI, defined as the following function:
 
  FNChangeFSI(A$,spritearea%,workspace%,worklimit%,
              oksave%,okinfo%,RETURN ram%,fast%) 

Where:

A$             the command line argument(s), see examples above
spritearea%    address for the output image
               or -1 to let ChangeFSI create a spritearea
workspace%     address for workspace start, extending up to worklimit%
               or -1 and worklimit% = 0 to use BASIC's variable workspace
               or -1 and worklimit% = end of wimp slot to use the whole slot
worklimit%     see description for workspace%
oksave%        when TRUE don't confirm file saves, assume OK
okinfo%        when TRUE output info messages during processing
ram%           returns the sprite area used for output
fast%          when TRUE will change to MODE 0 to speed processing by reducing
               the video bandwidth (only useful when no video RAM is fitted)

Returns 0   => output completed successfully
        1   => output completed successfully, some information messages shown
        100 => failed 

It may also produce an error (to whatever error handler is present) if it 
fails in a non recoverable manner.

The usefulness of workspace% = -1 and worklimit% = 0 may be limited since any
memory claimed during processing can't be released on completion (as using
the CLEAR keyword would clear the variables of the calling program too),
leading to a memory leak for multiple library calls.

When used with spritearea% = -1, the resulting sprite area can be released
after use with PROCremovearea.


System variables
================

For command line or BASIC library use, the variable ChangeFSI$Dir must be
set to the full pathname of the !ChangeFSI application, or certain
operations may fail.

For command line use, if a fatal error occurs during processing the error
message is captured in ChangeFSI$ReturnCode. This variable is cleared (unset)
if the requested operation completed successfully. 

By default ChangeFSI uses a 128K cache to speed processing; in particular,
JPEG files that fit inside the cache will be read much more quickly. You can
change the size of this cache by setting the variable ChangeFSI$Cache. For
example:

  *Set ChangeFSI$Cache 256K

You can also set the system variable ChangeFSI$PCDIndex to change the
PhotoCD resolution that is read. The default value is 3, which corresponds
to the base image.

@Further docs improvements
Output formats were only partially described, and supported
* Mention IRLAM output format switch in the CmdBasUse docs, add an example to the tests
* Explain what 'p15' is in CmdBasUse (was only explained in the input formats docs)
* Prefer S15 to S16

Delete support for C15 output. This appears to have been experimental as the resulting output had an embedded comment saying YUV but the data that followed was identical to a P15 RGB image. Also, ChangeFSI refused to load the C15 image it just wrote.
Delete support for S24 output switch. This was an undocumented alias for S32.
Add S15 as a possible output mode and prefer its use for 32k sprites - freeing up S16 for future 64k sprite support (and, logically S12 for 4k sprites).

@[236] Adjust scaling factors to avoid righthand/bottom edge conditions
source/ChangeFSI: After rounding up the scaled output size, recalculate the div/mul factors so they produce a whole number of pixels instead of falling off the end of the input array and mixing in black.
source/DesktopFE: Remove dead variable "safe%" and change tofitx/tofity to integers.
Minor clarification in CmdBasUse documentation.

Tested with a 100x100 green sprite, scaled by 5:3/5:3 and 3:7/3:7. Fixes ticket #236.

@Add support for type 15 (extended type) and 16 (4k colour) sprites
Sprite type 16 is now accepted as an input format, by defining the appropriate 4:4:4 colour lookup tables.
Type 15 class RGB is handled too with 1/2/4/8/12/15/16/32bpp sprites with and without RGB/BGR reversal.
Other changes:
Tighten up the check for BTPC files, it turns out BTPC 5 also exists but has an incompatible format, so rather than trying to decode them and fail, fail early.
Mention the return code in Documents/CmdBasUse.
Change real variable 'rgb' to integer since it's only holding a flag.

Tested with a variety of special sprites, and a BTPC 5 file.

By default ChangeFSI uses a 128K cache to speed processing. For command line
or BASIC library use, any input JPEG images must fit in the cache. You can

@Documentation update to accurately describe FNChangeFSI
Quite hard to guess what to do when the REM's have been crunched out of the binary otherwise.

@Removed another 2 debugging SWI WriteI's missed earlier.
Choices are now read from Choices: not <Choices$Write>
Changed FNChangeFSI so that -1 is used to determine where the workspace
comes from,rather than taking any -ve number.This now matches the docs.
Jiggled "output" template.

This gives a new function - FNChangeFSI - which provides the full command
line functionality of ChangeFSI. FNChangeFSI takes these arguments:

A$              a command line argument
spritearea%     an address, or -1 for the spritearea built by ChangeFSI
workspace%      an address, or -1 for ChangeFSI's other workspace
worklimit%      an address (unused if workspace% is -1)
fast%           TRUE for MODE 0 selection

It produces an error (to whatever error handler is present) if it fails.

It only saves the sprite to the file given in the command string if
spritearea% is equal to -1.

@Added btpc 4.1 support,though the detection in the main program has
always been there the binary vanished sometime round 1995.
Added abridged info on BTPC to the appropriate docs,plus docs updates
to reflect interesting information which seems to have been
progressively removed with time.
Yucky sprites added,Sprites23 deleted.
The output window now remembers where it was last opened instead of
always jumping to the middle of the screen.
You no longer need to be in a specific screen depth for any operation,
before (particularly using special mode "r") it needed to read the
palette in a particular mode - now if it realises it cannot it will look
for a default palette in its Palettes directory and only then give an
error.
Reinstated 256 colour special mode "t",this has always been missing the
4096 colour lookup table and most of the support for it was removed in
about 1992 though the assembler remained leading to a "No such variable"
error when trying to use it.GenCFSIict produces the table.

You can improve ChangeFSI's performance by first typing '*RMFaster BASIC'.
