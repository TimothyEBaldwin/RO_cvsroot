1.1
log
@Added btpc 4.1 support,though the detection in the main program has
always been there the binary vanished sometime round 1995.
Added abridged info on BTPC to the appropriate docs,plus docs updates
to reflect interesting information which seems to have been
progressively removed with time.
Yucky sprites added,Sprites23 deleted.
The output window now remembers where it was last opened instead of
always jumping to the middle of the screen.
You no longer need to be in a specific screen depth for any operation,
before (particularly using special mode "r") it needed to read the
palette in a particular mode - now if it realises it cannot it will look
for a default palette in its Palettes directory and only then give an
error.
Reinstated 256 colour special mode "t",this has always been missing the
4096 colour lookup table and most of the support for it was removed in
about 1992 though the assembler remained leading to a "No such variable"
error when trying to use it.GenCFSIict produces the table.

Version 1.20. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_20'
