1.1
log
@Nuked a BICEQS in the shell code that got missed.
Choices now stored in choices$write not locally.
pcdtemp spool file now put in wimp$scrapdir not locally.
Removed binary stored hpcdtoppm (now built from sources).
Added tests directory which contain some useful test images for Changefsi
Port of newer "hpcdtoppm",the bits changed from the original are all
demarked by "RISCOS_TWEAK".

Version 1.19. Tagged as 'ChangeFSI-1_19'

@Changes of hpcdtoppm:

v0.6:

- hpcdtoppm now finds the 64Base extension files from the
  path given for the image-file name. 

- small bug fixed.

v0.6 beta patch2:

- bug fixed for images with more than one file for
  each 64base plane

v0.6 beta patch1:

- bug fixed in opening the 64Base files.

- a debugging printf removed.

v0.6 beta:

- Code added to read 64Base


v0.5 pl1:

- Bug fixed in main.c, procedure f_ov. When writing all the
  images from overview files, a lot of file descriptors were
  opened, but never closed. This produced write errors if the
  machine has not enough file descriptors.

- procedure clear renamed to clearimpl to avoid collision with
  other libraries

- data types OUTGRAY and OUTRGB renamed to OUT1PL and OUT3PL,
  these data types are not bound to special color models.

- gsave/grestore added to postscript output

v0.5:

- Bug fixed in pgm writing procedure

- Missing ':' added in BoundingBox line of encapsulated
  Postscript

- postscript output with Floyd-Steinberg dithering added

- orientation chooser for contact sheet option -C

- accepts input from stdin (give '-' as filename)

- -S option for subrectangles

- procedure definitions in ANSI-C

- "turn on head" added.


v0.4:

- Additional Options -m, -pos, -rep, -crop

- pgm output added

- postscript output added

- Flip options

- color corrections

- primitive form of contact sheet

- simple method of jumping over reading errors in
  Huffman code

- optional Huffman-Lookuptable for speedup



v0.3:
- Additional Options -x, -a and -ycc

- bcopy thrown out.

- New datatype sBYTE for char. This fixes the problem with
  compilers which have the char unsigned. These got some
  'snow' in their pictures (merry christmas :-).

- Address arithmetik bug fixed in writepicture

v0.2:

- Small workaround for strange behavior of address-calculation
  of a c-compiler for NeXT.

- Improved rounding for integer maths.

- Thrown out floating arithmetic, changed color conversion to
  integer fixed point.

- PPM-writing-routines added. You can choose whether you
  want to use pbmplus-routines or the included routines.

- some ununused variables thrown out.
