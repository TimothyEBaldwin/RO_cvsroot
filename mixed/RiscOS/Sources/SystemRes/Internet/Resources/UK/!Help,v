@Add md5 utility A port of the FreeBSD tool of the same name, md5
calculates a long check sequence to see if the file has been transported across the internet without error.
Specifically, this is a snapshot of
  /lib/libmd/md5c.c revision 154479
  /lib/libmd/mdXhl.c revision 154479
  /sbin/md5/md5.c revision 238964
with a few tweaks for RISC OS.
Tested by comparing the MD5 sum of a few downloads from the downloads page.

@Finally got sick of changing the version number in !Boot and !Run and AunMap
so now only !Help tells you the version.
Added lots of "-Dlint"s as previously the (un)lucky developer who checked
the source out got their name stamped in the released binaries.
#if'd out a bum switch which only makes sense for FreeBSD.
A bit more of 'host' imported,probably not worth finishing.
