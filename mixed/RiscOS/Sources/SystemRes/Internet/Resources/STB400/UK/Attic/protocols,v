# Internet Protocol Database

# This file contains information regarding the known protocols used
# in the Internet. For each protocol a single line should be present
# with the following information:
#
#     official protocol name
#     protocol number
#     aliases
#
# Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
#  A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the
# end of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.
#
# Protocol names may contain any printable character other than a field
# delimiter, newline, or comment character.
#
# Note: the following entries are valid and should not be changed:
