Also automated version numbering of !Run/!Boot/!Help/AUNMap.

1.2
log
@Finally got sick of changing the version number in !Boot and !Run and AunMap
so now only !Help tells you the version.
Added lots of "-Dlint"s as previously the (un)lucky developer who checked
the source out got their name stamped in the released binaries.
#if'd out a bum switch which only makes sense for FreeBSD.
A bit more of 'host' imported,probably not worth finishing.
