@Add md5 utility A port of the FreeBSD tool of the same name, md5
calculates a long check sequence to see if the file has been transported across the internet without error.
Specifically, this is a snapshot of
  /lib/libmd/md5c.c revision 154479
  /lib/libmd/mdXhl.c revision 154479
  /sbin/md5/md5.c revision 238964
with a few tweaks for RISC OS.
Tested by comparing the MD5 sum of a few downloads from the downloads page.

Version 5.55. Tagged as 'Internet-5_55'
