@Add Tftp to the disc based !Internet commands
A TFTP client is described in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite manual but seems to have been lost somewhere along the way, perhaps when the Internet 5 work was done? TFTP is often used to load OS images or similar boot time stuff as it's a very simple (and insecure) protocol.
Port a contemporary client from FreeBSD (circa March 2000) with a few changes to allow it to run on RISC OS.
Makefile:
  Remove the BareMinUtils option. Nothing uses it, and it wouldn't work anyway since it's missing !Run.
  Add Tftp

Tested against OpenTFTP server 1.64 running on Windows, GETting and PUTing a number of files.

@Add md5 utility A port of the FreeBSD tool of the same name, md5
calculates a long check sequence to see if the file has been transported across the internet without error.
Specifically, this is a snapshot of
  /lib/libmd/md5c.c revision 154479
  /lib/libmd/mdXhl.c revision 154479
  /sbin/md5/md5.c revision 238964
with a few tweaks for RISC OS.
Tested by comparing the MD5 sum of a few downloads from the downloads page.

1.3
log
@New inetstat that uses sysctl instead of kvm_nread. Main visible difference
is that raw sockets are listed, and there is no danger of garbage being
printed if a socket opens or closes while running.

New sysctl that handles Internet 5.31's new sysctl code. No longer has any
hard-coded knowledge of any sysctls.

1.2
log
@InetStat and Route updated from FreeBSD. Particular items of note:
   Extra stats from InetStat, such as unwanted multicasts.
   Route now allows syntax like "route add 136.170.33/24 hobbit".
   InetStat -r now shows netmasks like 136.170.128/21.
More updates will be incorporated if/when Internet gets more updates.
