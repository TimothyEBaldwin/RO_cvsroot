 * Routing Table Entry, one per subnet from which a multicast could originate.
 * (Note: all addresses, subnet numbers and masks are kept in NETWORK order.)
 *
 * The Routing Table is stored as a doubly-linked list of these structures,
 * ordered by decreasing value of rt_originmask and, secondarily, by
 * decreasing value of rt_origin within each rt_originmask value.
 * This data structure is efficient for generating route reports, whether
 * full or partial, for processing received full reports, for clearing the
 * CHANGED flags, and for periodically advancing the timers in all routes.
 * It is not so efficient for updating a small number of routes in response
 * to a partial report.  In a stable topology, the latter are rare; if they
 * turn out to be costing a lot, we can add an auxiliary hash table for
 * faster access to arbitrary route entries.
