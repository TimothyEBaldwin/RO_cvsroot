@Add understanding of 1000 base T and 1000 base SX.
Tidy up help syntax.

@  Added new IPVars tool.
Detail:
  IPVars sets 6 variables per active interface.
  For interface ei0, you get:
    Inet$ei0$Addr       - IP Address
    Inet$ei0$Mask       - IP Subnet mask
    Inet$ei0$Host       - Host portion of address
    Inet$ei0$Network    - Network portion of address
    Inet$ei0$Broadcast  - Broadcast address for interface
    Inet$ei0$MAC        - MAC address of interface
Admin:
  Work done for STB-400.

@  Added verbose (-v) option.
Detail:
  Usually, numeric statistics with a value of zero are suppressed from
    the output (excepting TX and RX frame counts).  With this option,
    those fields are displayed, and the DCI SWI base is shown for each
    DIB too.
Admin:
  Requires RISC_OSLib 4.93 or later (for exported stdbool.h header)
    (RiscOS/Sources/Lib/RISC_OSLib  tag: RISC_OSLib-4_93 or later)
