4.1
log
@* Updated Makefile to allow building on minimalist STB !Internet.  If
  OPTIONS=STB is passed into the makefile this is built, otherwise the
  normal disc build is built.  Makefile expects Resources.<UserIF>.<Locale>
  to contain !Boot, !Run etc.  Not checked in yet.
* Added !MkInstSTB.
* Tested building STB and original builds.

Added for STB400 Baseline.
