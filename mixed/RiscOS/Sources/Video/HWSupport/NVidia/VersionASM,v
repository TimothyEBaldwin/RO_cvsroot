@Fix detection of RBSwapBit
Detail:
  s/Driver - When adding support for the red/blue swapping configuration options in NVidia 0.44, a crucial line to read back the GENCTRL register value from the card went AWOL, causing the mode change code to erroneously think that all cards supported RBSwapBit. For newer FX-series cards this was fine, but for older MX-series cards this had the net effect of causing the palette/gamma/cursor red/blue swapping to be wrong in 8bpp & 16bpp modes when the driver configuration is set to auto, and to cause 32bpp modes to always be wrong (either cursor or desktop red/blue swapped)
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix (with FX-series card)
  Should fix ticket 383:

@Fix unhelpful errors from *Configure NVidia. Fix harmless stack corruption.
Detail:
  s/Module - Replace any error received from OS_ReadArgs with the generic 'Configure option not recognised' error; OS_ReadArgs' errors are rarely useful in the case where the user has typed an option string incorrectly.
  Also shuffle things around a bit to allow a constant to be used for the amount of stack workspace required for the OS_ReadArgs output buffer. Previously the amount allocated was 4 bytes less than required, resulting in a (harmless) stomp of the stacked R1 (R1-R7 technically don't even need to be stacked)

@Revise Interlace handling. Add support for EDID reads which require the segment pointer to be set.
Detail:
  s/Driver - Update DoI2COp to automatically write the EDID segment pointer when accessing EDID addresses >= 256. Remove IIC stop between writing the EDID offset & reading the data - was unnecessary and would cause the segment pointer to reset.
  s/GraphicsV - Remove GraphicsV_SetInterlace implementation, didn't do anything useful and is now deprecated. Make GraphicsV_SetMode reject any interlaced modes. Tweak GraphicsV_IICOp to treat head 0 as the current head and head 1 as the opposite head - makes behaviour slightly more sensible considering that there are only a couple of interfaces which support multiple heads and no way of reading the current head.

@Allow for extra control over red/blue swapping of 16bpp modes
Detail:
  s/Driver, s/Module - Add support for a new configuration option, '-alt16bpp'. This causes the module to reverse its decision about whether the gamma tables + cursor should be red/blue swapped when in 16bpp modes, improving compatibility with software which performs red/blue swapping manually (e.g. Geminus).

Admin:
  Tested in Iyonix ROM softload

@Allow configuration of red/blue swapping
Detail:
  This change adds support for using "*Configure NVidia" to control red/blue swapping of 8bpp, 16bpp and 32bpp screen modes, on a per-card basis.
  By default 'auto' mode is used, which will use the same red/blue swapping logic as the previous version of the module
  Configuration settings are stored in our private CMOS area as returned by the PCI module
  File changes:
  - Makefile, Resources/UK/CmdHelp, Resources/UK/Messages - Added messages files. Only the CmdHelp file is used at the moment, but a main messages file is included to keep the build system happy.
  - s/Module - Add code to read and write settings from CMOS and handling for the NVidia configure item. Standalone messages handling fixed up to work the way the CModule makefile fragment expects.
  - s/Driver - Use configuration settings to decide whether to red/blue swap on a per-mode basis
  - s/GraphicsV - Updated to use a pixel format list held in workspace instead of the fixed ones that were defined here
  - s/MsgCode - Use our messages file, not the PCI modules!
  - h/DriverInterface - Updated C workspace struct to match assembler workspace definition

The code can easily be disabled in the future once it's no longer needed.

@Rework of GraphicsV 14
In the despatcher bits 16-23 are cleared (the head number), then in GV_IICOp they are inspected properly. The GV_SelectHead just does an aliasing AND operation, so any of 2 billion odd numbers will select head 1 and any of 2 billion even numbers will select head 0.
The register use in DoI2COp was eyewatering, it sort of looks like ATPCS but then passes return results in R4 (?!).
Untested due to lack of hardware, might need more work.

@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Removed the SED script preprocessing step as this only affected
nv_info.c, the script was translating unaligned reads of UINT32 and
UINT16 types - instead this one file now uses the 'memaccess' switch to
split these into LDRB's.
Delete PostAsm.s, no longer needed because of the above. MicroDelay
transplanted to use the existing delay code via an alternate entry.
NOP in fast service table changed to MOV R0,R0 as NOP is now a value v7
instruction.
Deprecated Pull sequence split out in the Service_PCI code.
Set the CPU switch to 5TE so the PLD instructions don't result in a
warning.
Compiles, but not functionally tested.

@Fix PowerCycleEngine trashing random memory
Detail:
  s/Driver - Fixed register misuse leading to PowerCycleEngine trashing random memory instead of writing to the video card. In the instance where it crashed (with the zero page relocation kernel) it was harmlessly writing to DebuggerSpace, but it wouldn't surprise me if the address is somewhat random.
