1.1
log
@Allow configuration of red/blue swapping
Detail:
  This change adds support for using "*Configure NVidia" to control red/blue swapping of 8bpp, 16bpp and 32bpp screen modes, on a per-card basis.
  By default 'auto' mode is used, which will use the same red/blue swapping logic as the previous version of the module
  Configuration settings are stored in our private CMOS area as returned by the PCI module
  File changes:
  - Makefile, Resources/UK/CmdHelp, Resources/UK/Messages - Added messages files. Only the CmdHelp file is used at the moment, but a main messages file is included to keep the build system happy.
  - s/Module - Add code to read and write settings from CMOS and handling for the NVidia configure item. Standalone messages handling fixed up to work the way the CModule makefile fragment expects.
  - s/Driver - Use configuration settings to decide whether to red/blue swap on a per-mode basis
  - s/GraphicsV - Updated to use a pixel format list held in workspace instead of the fixed ones that were defined here
  - s/MsgCode - Use our messages file, not the PCI modules!
  - h/DriverInterface - Updated C workspace struct to match assembler workspace definition
Admin:
  Tested in Iyonix ROM softload
  Requires Kernel-5_35-4_79_2_216 to build, and Colours-1_91 and Tungsten-0_49 to run correctly


Version 0.43. Tagged as 'NVidia-0_43'
