1.2
log
@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Removed the SED script preprocessing step as this only affected
nv_info.c, the script was translating unaligned reads of UINT32 and
UINT16 types - instead this one file now uses the 'memaccess' switch to
split these into LDRB's.
Delete PostAsm.s, no longer needed because of the above. MicroDelay
transplanted to use the existing delay code via an alternate entry.
NOP in fast service table changed to MOV R0,R0 as NOP is now a value v7
instruction.
Deprecated Pull sequence split out in the Service_PCI code.
Set the CPU switch to 5TE so the PLD instructions don't result in a
warning.
Compiles, but not functionally tested.
