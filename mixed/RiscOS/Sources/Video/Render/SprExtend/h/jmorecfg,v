@Transcode arithmetics
Detail:
  Import of the raw coefficient Huffman entropy compressor elements of the IJG8d library.
  We don't need a full compressor (ala JCompMod) since there's never a need to go all the way through IDCT/upsampling/colour conversion only to reverse the whole process; it's sufficient only to collect up the raw coefficients and recompress them as a baseline JPEG.
  Two extra (temporary) dynamic areas are introduced, once to hold the raw coefficients and the other to act as a scratch file to make the JPEG in. See Doc/JPEGMmgr.

@Import of IJG8d library sources
Detail:
  Using the decoder in "example.c" as a starting point, we try to follow that sequence more closely even if in our embedded implementation some of the functions don't do much.
  Uses the default colour backend for 32bpp BGR output for most of the unusual cases.
  The most common 2x2 subsampling case uses a custom merged upsampler and colour converter, with colour output directly in RISC OS format for the respective screen mode.

@Update headers to stock copy
Detail:
  Added headers jerror, jmorecfg, jpegint from IJG8d. Removed jpegdata header.
  Bulk rename of structure members to match newer headers, some RISCOS-isms wrapped in #ifdef RISCOS, retained for the time being.
  Assembler code now gets cinfo member offsets from jhdr.s derived from the C header rather than keeping its own dangerous copy of the offsets.
Admin
  Note: this has broken CFSI-jpeg as it expects the error values to be at the top of cinfo.

1.1.2.3
log
@Reinstate C code version of jdhuff.
In huff_decode_blocks the block pointer wasn't being incremented, as it was in the assembler.

1.1.2.4
log
@Create assembler equivalents of C colour conversions, approx 10% speed up.
Add new switch ASMCOLOR to select which to use, C or assembler.
Remove FILE_ exit trace concept, just use __FILE__ instead in exit_erl.
Add some comments to exit_erl and friends.
A few bits of cinfo setup moved into start_pass_huff_decoder() or eliminated.
Bumped up the precision of SCALE_BITS in the C colour handling so FIX() uses more bits of an int.
Deleted the unused remenants of light dithering in the 8bpp colour converter - saves a few cycles.
colour_convert_8 and colour_convert_16 no longer save entry registers the C compiler doesn't care about.
Update genyuvtabs to EXPORT the table bases.
Split out the compilation of IJG files as separate objects in the make file, rather than including them from within rojpeg, which is itself included from putscaled.
