log
@Fix some sprite rendering issues. Add a new test app.
Detail:
  Bug fixes:
  - Sources/SprOp: Fixed a bug with PlotMask of old-format sprites not working correctly if the sprite is off the left edge of the screen. Fixed Log2bpp/Log2bpc confusion when plotting to double-pixel modes, caused by double pixel bodge being disabled.
  - Sources/SprTrans: Fixed transformed plotting of sprites with lefthand wastage drawing the sprite offset if a transformation matrix is used
  - c/PutScaled: Fixed another double pixel bodge related bug, when plotting double pixel sprites at certain offsets and with the two-at-a-time plotting code
  Test code:
  - Test/c/bigtest: A fairly comprehensive test app that generates lots of random sprites in every supported mode, and plots them using all APIs and options into all supported destination modes. Output is redirected to sprites (so the capabilities of the host video hardware are irrelevant), and checked against a model of what the expected output should look like. Also features some JPEG tests. A fast computer is recommended when running the tests!
  - Test/mkbigtest,fd7: Helper script to build bigtest
  - Test/bigtest2,ffb: Helper BASIC program to allow easy re-testing of failure cases
  - Test/JPEGs/*: Test JPEGs and reference sprites which are used by the JPEG test. JPEGs chosen to exercise all the output formats the JPEG code supports.

  Tested on BB-xM
