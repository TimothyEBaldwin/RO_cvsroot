@Transcode progressives
Detail:
  Enable the Huffman and arithmetic progressive code paths, these are handled much like arithmetic: undo the entropy part of the encoding process into a dynamic area full of raw coefficients, recompress as a baseline image, copy the image into the JPEG workspace for real time redraw.

@Transcode arithmetics
Detail:
  Import of the raw coefficient Huffman entropy compressor elements of the IJG8d library.
  We don't need a full compressor (ala JCompMod) since there's never a need to go all the way through IDCT/upsampling/colour conversion only to reverse the whole process; it's sufficient only to collect up the raw coefficients and recompress them as a baseline JPEG.
  Two extra (temporary) dynamic areas are introduced, once to hold the raw coefficients and the other to act as a scratch file to make the JPEG in. See Doc/JPEGMmgr.
