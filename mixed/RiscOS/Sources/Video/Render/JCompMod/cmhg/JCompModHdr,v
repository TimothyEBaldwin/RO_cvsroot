1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
!MkInstall:
   Fixed to install the module in the right place.
jcompmod.c:
   Use defines generated from CMHG.
   Use the correct error base.
   Keep our international errors in compact (const) form, rather than using _kernel_oserror structs.
   Update function prototypes to match CMHG.
trace.c:
   Remove use of SKIP macro, so we don't depend on OSLib headers for just that.
JCompModHdr:
   Updated to use the date and version from VersionNum
   Renamed for shared makefiles

Version 0.07. Tagged as 'JCompMod-0_07'
