@Sync back with IJG reference version
Along the way the original IJG library code has gained some needless diffs, like commenting out unused functions one line at a time, whitespace, addition of unused headers, that sort of thing. Put back the reference version, and switch the changes using the preprocessor (ifdef RISCOS).
Remove the Thomas Lane attribution for "jmemnoal.c", this doesn't appear in IJG5 nor any earlier version, so falls under the Castle licence.
This commit probably doesn't build, it's just a reference point.

Tagged as JCompMod-0_06-IJG5RefPoint.
