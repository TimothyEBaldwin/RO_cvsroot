1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import on a vendor branch for ARM's BSD-licenced releases of the FPASC.
This is version 1.13. The original distribution archive is in doc/fpe400.zip.
The coresrc subdirectory is the only part of the official distribution used
in the RISC OS implementation, and is rearranged to use a "s" subdirectory
rather than a ".s" suffix as is customary for RISC OS builds.
