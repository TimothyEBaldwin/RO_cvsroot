@  Support for processors which feature Thumb mode.
Detail:
  Added check to make sure we ignore undefined instruction exceptions generated
  while in Thumb state.
Admin:
  Changes originally committed by kbracey on 2001-05-31.
  This fix was originally applied to an earlier version of ARM's code and has
  been rebased at ARM's version 1.13 for licensing reasons.
  However, since this was the last change before ARM version 1.13 was merged
  into the RISC OS source tree (on 2001-07-25), it is also representative of
  the the RISC OS sources at that date, barring licence header differences.

Tagged as 'Thumb-fix' and 'FPASC-4_16'

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import on a vendor branch for ARM's BSD-licenced releases of the FPASC.
This is version 1.13. The original distribution archive is in doc/fpe400.zip.
The coresrc subdirectory is the only part of the official distribution used
in the RISC OS implementation, and is rearranged to use a "s" subdirectory
rather than a ".s" suffix as is customary for RISC OS builds.
