@  Multiple fixes

Detail:
  * Denormalised numbers now held consistently in their nominal precision.
    MVF/MNF/ABS of a denormalised number without a change of precision
    treated specially, much like signalling NaNs. This prevents spurious
    underflow traps if they're enabled. Previously

         ; Underflow traps on
         LDFS    F0,DenormalisedSingle
         MVFS    F0,F0

    or

         ; Underflow traps off
         LDFD    F0,SmallestNormalDouble
         MUFD    F0,F0,#0.5
         ; Turn underflow traps on
         STFD    F0,xxx

    would have generated traps.

  * LDFP/STFP rearrangement of NaN significands reinstated, as DDT
    can now make use of it.

  * Typos in over/underflow code for LDFP corrected.

  * Experimental dynamic rounding controls added to FPSR (for emulator
    only). Currently disabled; does not affect LDFP or STFP yet.

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import on a vendor branch for ARM's BSD-licenced releases of the FPASC.
This is version 1.13. The original distribution archive is in doc/fpe400.zip.
The coresrc subdirectory is the only part of the official distribution used
in the RISC OS implementation, and is rearranged to use a "s" subdirectory
rather than a ".s" suffix as is customary for RISC OS builds.
