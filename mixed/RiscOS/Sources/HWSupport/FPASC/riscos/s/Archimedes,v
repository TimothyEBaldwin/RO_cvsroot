1.2
log
@  Updated to build using shared makefiles
Detail:
  Makefile rewritten. All the changes elsewhere reflect the fact that
  CoreDir, VeneerDir and FileExt are now passed in from the makefile,
  since that has visibility of filespec differences between OSes.

1.1
log
@  Added options files to allow FPEmulator binaries in !System to be built using standard Machine identifiers.
Detail:
  This is necessitated by the fact that from version 4.34, we include
  Hdr:CPU.Arch to decide whether to adapt to architectural changes in ARMv5
  and ARMv7, and that header file uses the Machine build switch.
