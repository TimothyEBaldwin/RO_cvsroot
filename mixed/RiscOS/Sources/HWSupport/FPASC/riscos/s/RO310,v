1.2
log
@  Updated to build using shared makefiles
Detail:
  Makefile rewritten. All the changes elsewhere reflect the fact that
  CoreDir, VeneerDir and FileExt are now passed in from the makefile,
  since that has visibility of filespec differences between OSes.

1.1
log
@  * Fixed install phase;
  * Moved stripdepnd out of Makefile;
  * Variants passed on amu command line.
Detail:
  * You can now specify the precise build variant of the FPEmulator by passing
    System=... and FPE_APCS=... on the amu command line. There are now more
    files in riscos.s to set the options for various types (as per Wimp).
    The default FPE as was is now built with: System="RO380" FPE_APCS="3/32bit"
Admin:
  Builds.
