log
@  Updated to build using shared makefiles
Detail:
  Makefile rewritten. All the changes elsewhere reflect the fact that
  CoreDir, VeneerDir and FileExt are now passed in from the makefile,
  since that has visibility of filespec differences between OSes.

log
@  Change to build options.
Detail:
  Machine=32 is now built so that it doesn't use UMULL. This is because we
  now require it to operate on ARMv3 Risc PCs and A7000(+).
Admin:
  Untested, but should be low risk.
