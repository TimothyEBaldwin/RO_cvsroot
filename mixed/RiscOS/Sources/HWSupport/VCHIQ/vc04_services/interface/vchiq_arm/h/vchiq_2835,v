@Update to latest version of VCHIQ sources
Detail:
  This updates our VCHIQ sources to rev 95009dbb77 of the official sources from the Raspberry Pi Linux github repo.
  From our perspective, the important changes are:
  * Provides compatbility with the latest firmware
  * Not compatible with older firmware (older than around Nov 2012?), including the firmware we've typically been using until now
  * Clients of the module now need to specify the version number of the service they're communicating with
  * Source is dual BSD/GPL licenced, with us opting to use the BSD license in order to allow the module to be included in ROM instead of as a softload on disc
  * Ability to build softload version has been removed from the makefile, as it's now a redundant option
  File changes:
  - !MkRom - enable throwback
  - Makefile - Update for building latest sources. Remove special softload rules. Enable ability to build ROM version.
  - c/vchiq_riscos, s/asm - Update RISC OS compatbility layer to directly emulate the corresponding Linux calls now that the VCOS abstraction layer has been removed from the VCHIQ sources
  - h/VCHIQ, h/VCHIQWrap, hdr/VCHIQ - Add the service version number entries to the vchiq_service_t/SERVICE_CREATION_T structs
  - vc04_services/* - Updated to latest official sources, with relevant changes to allow compilation for RISC OS
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi
  Updated GPU firmware will likely be required!

@Add initial version of VCHIQ driver
Detail:
  This is a port of the VCHIQ Linux driver, using sources from the Raspberry Pi github
  The Linux version of the driver compiles to two seperate libraries - the kernel library/module and a user-space library for linking with programs. Communication between the two involves ioctl calls to a file in /dev/
  The RISC OS version takes a slightly different route, omitting the ioctl interface and instead using the 'vchiq_shim' code to talk directly to the kernel code, using an API identical to the Linux user space one.
  Programs are able to communicate with the module via SWIs which provide a close match for the C APIs. The module also exports a C header containing wrapper functions to convert the SWIs back to the C API, aiding porting of existing code.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  Code is currently dual licensed BSD+GPL, with the GPL code (in vc04_services) being the dominant licence.
