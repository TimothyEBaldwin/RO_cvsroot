@Update to latest version of VCHIQ sources
Detail:
  This updates our VCHIQ sources to rev 95009dbb77 of the official sources from the Raspberry Pi Linux github repo.
  From our perspective, the important changes are:
  * Provides compatbility with the latest firmware
  * Not compatible with older firmware (older than around Nov 2012?), including the firmware we've typically been using until now
  * Clients of the module now need to specify the version number of the service they're communicating with
  * Source is dual BSD/GPL licenced, with us opting to use the BSD license in order to allow the module to be included in ROM instead of as a softload on disc
  * Ability to build softload version has been removed from the makefile, as it's now a redundant option
  File changes:
  - !MkRom - enable throwback
  - Makefile - Update for building latest sources. Remove special softload rules. Enable ability to build ROM version.
  - c/vchiq_riscos, s/asm - Update RISC OS compatbility layer to directly emulate the corresponding Linux calls now that the VCOS abstraction layer has been removed from the VCHIQ sources
  - h/VCHIQ, h/VCHIQWrap, hdr/VCHIQ - Add the service version number entries to the vchiq_service_t/SERVICE_CREATION_T structs
  - vc04_services/* - Updated to latest official sources, with relevant changes to allow compilation for RISC OS
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi
  Updated GPU firmware will likely be required!

/**
  * \file
  *
  * This provides event flags (as per Nucleus Event Groups) based on a
  * mutex, a semaphore (per waiting thread) and a timer (per waiting
  * thread).
  * 
  * The data structure is a 32 bit unsigned int (the current set of
  * flags) and a linked list of clients waiting to be 'satisfied'.
  *
  * The mutex merely locks access to the data structure. If a client
  * calls vcos_event_flags_get() and the requested bits are not already
  * present, it then sleeps on its per-thread semaphore after adding
  * this semaphore to the queue waiting. It also sets up a timer.
  *
  * The per-thread semaphore and timer are actually stored in the
  * thread context (joinable thread). In future it may become necessary
  * to support non-VCOS threads by using thread local storage to
  * create these objects and associate them with the thread.

@Add initial version of VCHIQ driver
Detail:
  This is a port of the VCHIQ Linux driver, using sources from the Raspberry Pi github
  The Linux version of the driver compiles to two seperate libraries - the kernel library/module and a user-space library for linking with programs. Communication between the two involves ioctl calls to a file in /dev/
  The RISC OS version takes a slightly different route, omitting the ioctl interface and instead using the 'vchiq_shim' code to talk directly to the kernel code, using an API identical to the Linux user space one.
  Programs are able to communicate with the module via SWIs which provide a close match for the C APIs. The module also exports a C header containing wrapper functions to convert the SWIs back to the C API, aiding porting of existing code.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  Code is currently dual licensed BSD+GPL, with the GPL code (in vc04_services) being the dominant licence.
