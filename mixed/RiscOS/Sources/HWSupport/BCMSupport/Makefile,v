@Implement BCMSupport module
Detail:
  The BCMSupport module provides the following functionality:
  * A SWI interface which allows multiple clients to send and receive messages via the ARM<->GPU mailbox
  * A higher-level SWI interface to make dealing with the mailbox property interface easier
  * A CPU clock device for controlling the ARM clock rate and measuring the SoC temperature
  The implementation is mostly in C and aims to be thread/multicore safe
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1B/2B/3B

# CModule is equally useful for assembler modules. Its advantages over the
# AAmModule makefile are that you can use multiple source files (permitting
# more encapsulation, which is good programing practice) and it allows you
# to use non-postion-independent code, provided you do BL __RelocCode early
# in module initialisation.
