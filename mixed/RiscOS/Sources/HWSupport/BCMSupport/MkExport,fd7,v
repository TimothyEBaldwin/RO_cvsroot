@Implement BCMSupport module
Detail:
  The BCMSupport module provides the following functionality:
  * A SWI interface which allows multiple clients to send and receive messages via the ARM<->GPU mailbox
  * A higher-level SWI interface to make dealing with the mailbox property interface easier
  * A CPU clock device for controlling the ARM clock rate and measuring the SoC temperature
  The implementation is mostly in C and aims to be thread/multicore safe
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1B/2B/3B


Version 0.03. Tagged as 'BCMSupport-0_03'
