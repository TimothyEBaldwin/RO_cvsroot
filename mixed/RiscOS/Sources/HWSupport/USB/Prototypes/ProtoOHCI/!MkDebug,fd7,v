1.2
log
@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
This module did not compile previously, and still does not, with the
number of errors deemed too much effort to resolve given it's no longer
used.
Therefore, the makefile has been reworked with the eye-of-faith so the
steps all work but no binary results.

Version 0.02. Tagged as 'ProtoOHCI-0_02'
