The Prototype USB drivers in this directory sit directly on an OHCI
controller and talk to the relevant devices.

ProtoUMouse is a mouse driver.
ProtoUKey is a keyboard driver.
ProtoUComb is a combined keyboard and mouse driver for keyboards with a mouse
interface as well (the mouse plugs into the keyboard).

They were tested on a Belkin keyboard and mouse.

ProtoUPrint supplies a devicefs device which supports bulk transfers.  This
can be used for printing to, and has been tested with the LexmarkZ12 and the
Canon 2100.

ProtoOHCI is a prototype for the dynamically created DeviceFS entries which
reads complete descriptors from devices and sends a service call for drivers
to latch onto the driver.  The format of the data sent in the service call
can be seen in the source.@

@  Addition of Prototype OHCI driver.

Detail:
  Up till now the prototypes have taken complete control of the OHCI
controller to driver the peripherals.  ProtoOHCI automatically adds and
removes entries in DeviceFS as USB devices are added and removed, and issues
a service call when a new device is plugged in after reading its descriptors
allowing specific drivers to latch on.

Admin:
  Extensively used during development on the customer L SDB.
