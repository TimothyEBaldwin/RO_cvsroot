1.1
log
@Add the ability to build the USB drivers as HAL-compatible static libraries
Detail:
  build/Makefile, build/OBJEHCIDriver, build/OBJOHCIDriver, build/OBJUSBDriver - Modified makefiles to build the HAL libs during the export libs phase
  build/!MkHAL,fd7 - Handy script for building the HAL libs
  build/Hdr/usbhal - Header containing definitions for the assembler code. Also gets exported so that HALs know how much workspace to reserve.
  build/c/usbhal - HAL version of usbmodule.c & port.c. Also contains the keyboard scan code, adapted from the code in the Tungsten HAL.
  build/s/porthal - Assembler versions of some port.c routines that were easier to do in assembler than C
  build/s/halheap - OS_Heap code that's been adapted for use in the HAL. Could easily be changed into a standalone library instead of being part of the HAL USB libs. Supports memory-efficient allocation of aligned blocks.
  build/c/ehcihal - HAL version of ehcimodule.c. Currently only supports EHCI controllers exposed via HAL_USBControllerInfo (i.e. no PCI support)
  build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule, build/c/port - Moved riscos_irq_clear into port.c. Removed unused microtime() function.
  build/c/usbmouse - Strip out some debug-related code in non-debug builds
  build/Version - Updated version numbers
  dev/usb/c/ehci, dev/usb/h/ehcivar - Adapted to add support for the HAL build. Apart from the base changes, the code has also been tweaked to significantly reduce the amount of memory used at runtime by the HAL version of the driver.
  dev/usb/c/hid, dev/usb/c/uhub, dev/usb/c/usb, dev/usb/c/usb_quirks, dev/usb/c/usb_subr, dev/usb/c/usbdi, dev/usb/c/usbdi_util, dev/usb/c/usbroothub_subr - Changes to support HAL builds. Mainly disabling bits that won't work in the HAL or disabling bits for RISC OS in general if they weren't being used in the first place.
  dev/usb/c/ohci, dev/usb/h/ohcivar - Basic changes to support HAL builds. However HAL OHCI support is still incomplete.
  dev/usb/h/usb_port - Added support for the HAL build. Also tweaked logprintf definition to get rid of logprintf calls entirely in non-debug builds.
  dev/usb/h/usbdivar - Added support for the HAL build.
  dev/usb/h/usbhal - New header used by the HAL build. Gets included by every C file to ensure the compiler doesn't use sb, and contains structs/macros to allow access to the shared workspace.
Admin:
  HAL & non-HAL builds tested on rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook.
  Non-HAL builds tested with Iyonix ROM softload.
  Needs latest Kernel source for OSEntries.h export.
