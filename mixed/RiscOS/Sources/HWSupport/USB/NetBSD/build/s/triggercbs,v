@Fix null pointer dereferences. Add protection against DeviceFS xfers being multiply inserted into their pipes xfer queue.
Detail:
  build/Version - Increased version numbers
  build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule - Fixed null pointer dereferences in debug code
  build/c/port, build/s/triggercbs - Fix debug code in tsleep() using hardcoded IRQsema ptr. Now requests the right pointer from build/s/triggercbs.
  build/c/usbmodule - Fix null pointer deferences in debug code and MonitorTX/MonitorRX handlers. Add xfer_busy and delayed_read flags to devstream struct in order to track whether the xfer associated with the stream is busy or not. Previously if the TxWakeUp/RxWakeUp device calls were made on a stream which already had an active xfer, the xfer would end up being inserted in the USB pipes xfer queue twice, creating a circular reference, resulting in (at the least) infinite loops in usbd_dump_queue() when debugging is enabled. Now, in the case of reads, a second read will automatically be issued once the first completes, while in the case of writes, the write request will simply be ignored. This isn't a proper fix for all the shortcomings of the DeviceFS interface, but at least the code is now a little bit safer.

@Make RHENIUM build switch go away. Misc housekeeping
Detail:
  build/Makefile, build/!MkDebug,fd7 - Debug versions of the modules can now be built just by passing "DEBUG=TRUE" to amu
  build/!MkRhenium,fd7 - Deleted obsolete file
  build/Version - Increased version numbers
  build/c/ehcihal, build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule - Only accept USB controllers if HAL_USBControllerInfo says the struct size is an exact match with what we expect. Rework USB controller enumeration to allow modules to properly support both PCI and HAL controllers being available on the same machine, and without RHENIUM switch (module sources only).
  build/c/ehcimodule - Get rid of remaining RHENIUM bits; RHENIUM flag no longer needed for 32bit wide register reads/writes to be supported
  build/c/ohcimodule, build/cmhg/ohcimodhead, dev/usb/c/ohci - Get rid of remaining RHENIUM bits; RHENIUM flag no longer needed for HAL port power controls to be supported.
  build/c/usbhal, build/c/usbmodule, dev/usb/c/uhub, dev/usb/h/usb_port - Get rid of empty riscos_failed_device function
  build/s/call_veneer, build/s/triggercbs - Use Entry/EXIT macros to avoid single-reg LDM/STM performance warnings. Convert tabs to spaces.
  dev/usb/h/usb - Get rid of RHENIUM switch on USB_PORT_RESET_DELAY. Now always uses non-RHENIUM value of 100ms.

@Update to work with zero page relocation. Remove ability to cancel transfers by pressing escape
Detail:
  build/c/port - Removed ability to cancel transfers by pressing escape. Too dangerous for things like mass storage devices, and the code won't work anyway for the common case of being in the wimp
  build/s/triggercbs - Try using OS_ReadSysInfo 6 to get IRQsema ptr before falling back on legacy address
  build/Version - Updated version numbers

@         changes and bug fixes that came to light following USB2 launch.
Detail:
         - VarVal launching.. string length was incorrectly calculated.
         - USB VarVals now correctly cleared if device failed during
           enumeration, after first SetVarVal call.
         - Triggercbs() modified to check interrupt context and be
           refuse (quietly) to trigger callbacks if interrupts threaded
           (result of possible issue .. but perhaps wise)
         - Added third QueryDelay variable, and an Info file to describe
           what does what.
Admin:
         checked at Castle.. due for extended check via beta test site
         before formal release.
