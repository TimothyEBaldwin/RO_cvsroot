@  Fix HAL breakages caused by HAL_USBPortPower calls
Detail:
  In version 1.05, the USB library which is exported for the use of the HAL
  keyboard scan code unconditionally required the HAL_USBPortPower symbol.
  Not all HALs provide that entry point; for those that didn't, they would
  no longer link. Fixed by use of a bit of magic assembler.
Admin:
  Verified that OMAP3 ROM now builds again.

Version 1.06. Tagged as 'NetBSD-1_06'
