1.1
log
@  Build fix
Detail:
  The build utility makedevs, compiled at build time, is now built using the
  HostTools shared makefile, and so will execute on any RISC OS build host
  even if the default compiler options are to target an incompatible ARM
  architecture.
Admin:
  Tested using an APCS-R build on an Iyonix.
