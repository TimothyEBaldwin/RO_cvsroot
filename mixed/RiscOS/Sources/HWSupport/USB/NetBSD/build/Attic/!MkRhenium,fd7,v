@Make RHENIUM build switch go away. Misc housekeeping
Detail:
  build/Makefile, build/!MkDebug,fd7 - Debug versions of the modules can now be built just by passing "DEBUG=TRUE" to amu
  build/!MkRhenium,fd7 - Deleted obsolete file
  build/Version - Increased version numbers
  build/c/ehcihal, build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule - Only accept USB controllers if HAL_USBControllerInfo says the struct size is an exact match with what we expect. Rework USB controller enumeration to allow modules to properly support both PCI and HAL controllers being available on the same machine, and without RHENIUM switch (module sources only).
  build/c/ehcimodule - Get rid of remaining RHENIUM bits; RHENIUM flag no longer needed for 32bit wide register reads/writes to be supported
  build/c/ohcimodule, build/cmhg/ohcimodhead, dev/usb/c/ohci - Get rid of remaining RHENIUM bits; RHENIUM flag no longer needed for HAL port power controls to be supported.
  build/c/usbhal, build/c/usbmodule, dev/usb/c/uhub, dev/usb/h/usb_port - Get rid of empty riscos_failed_device function
  build/s/call_veneer, build/s/triggercbs - Use Entry/EXIT macros to avoid single-reg LDM/STM performance warnings. Convert tabs to spaces.
  dev/usb/h/usb - Get rid of RHENIUM switch on USB_PORT_RESET_DELAY. Now always uses non-RHENIUM value of 100ms.
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM, Iyonix, Raspberry Pi

@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Remove some of the proliferation of !Mk[stuff] files due to lack of
relevance.
Combined the OBJ[target] listings into the main makefile with a switch.
Remove a spurious # from the EHCIMessages.
