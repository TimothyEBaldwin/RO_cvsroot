@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Remove some of the proliferation of !Mk[stuff] files due to lack of
relevance.
Combined the OBJ[target] listings into the main makefile with a switch.
Remove a spurious # from the EHCIMessages.

@Add the ability to build the USB drivers as HAL-compatible static libraries
Detail:
  build/Makefile, build/OBJEHCIDriver, build/OBJOHCIDriver, build/OBJUSBDriver - Modified makefiles to build the HAL libs during the export libs phase
  build/!MkHAL,fd7 - Handy script for building the HAL libs
  build/Hdr/usbhal - Header containing definitions for the assembler code. Also gets exported so that HALs know how much workspace to reserve.
  build/c/usbhal - HAL version of usbmodule.c & port.c. Also contains the keyboard scan code, adapted from the code in the Tungsten HAL.
  build/s/porthal - Assembler versions of some port.c routines that were easier to do in assembler than C
  build/s/halheap - OS_Heap code that's been adapted for use in the HAL. Could easily be changed into a standalone library instead of being part of the HAL USB libs. Supports memory-efficient allocation of aligned blocks.
  build/c/ehcihal - HAL version of ehcimodule.c. Currently only supports EHCI controllers exposed via HAL_USBControllerInfo (i.e. no PCI support)
  build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule, build/c/port - Moved riscos_irq_clear into port.c. Removed unused microtime() function.
  build/c/usbmouse - Strip out some debug-related code in non-debug builds
  build/Version - Updated version numbers
  dev/usb/c/ehci, dev/usb/h/ehcivar - Adapted to add support for the HAL build. Apart from the base changes, the code has also been tweaked to significantly reduce the amount of memory used at runtime by the HAL version of the driver.
  dev/usb/c/hid, dev/usb/c/uhub, dev/usb/c/usb, dev/usb/c/usb_quirks, dev/usb/c/usb_subr, dev/usb/c/usbdi, dev/usb/c/usbdi_util, dev/usb/c/usbroothub_subr - Changes to support HAL builds. Mainly disabling bits that won't work in the HAL or disabling bits for RISC OS in general if they weren't being used in the first place.
  dev/usb/c/ohci, dev/usb/h/ohcivar - Basic changes to support HAL builds. However HAL OHCI support is still incomplete.
  dev/usb/h/usb_port - Added support for the HAL build. Also tweaked logprintf definition to get rid of logprintf calls entirely in non-debug builds.
  dev/usb/h/usbdivar - Added support for the HAL build.
  dev/usb/h/usbhal - New header used by the HAL build. Gets included by every C file to ensure the compiler doesn't use sb, and contains structs/macros to allow access to the shared workspace.
Admin:
  HAL & non-HAL builds tested on rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook.
  Non-HAL builds tested with Iyonix ROM softload.
  Needs latest Kernel source for OSEntries.h export.

@Fix modules so resources don't get included twice in ROM builds
Detail:
  A couple of the USB modules were including their resources both in the Messages module and within themselves, leading to wasted ROM space
  build/OBJOHCIDriver, build/OBJUSBDriver - Tweaked makefiles so that ohcimsgs.o and usbmsgs.o only get built/linked for RAM builds
  build/c/usbmodule - Fix erroneous attempt to free non-registered resource files in ROM builds
  Version - Increased OHCIDriver & USBDriver version numbers
Admin:
  Tested with Iyonix ROM softload. Saves approx 48k of ROM space.
  Fixes bug #265

@Import of USB driver suitable for generic PCI based OHCI controllers.
Correction of spelling of busses to buses (noun plural).
OHCIdriver only responds to PCI service call to lookup vendor name when
the device is of class OHCI controller.
