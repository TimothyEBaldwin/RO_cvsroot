log
@  Changes to work with TCPIPLibs 5.47.
Detail:
  NetBSD/FreeBSD differences in the naming of certain macros are now resolved
  in TCPIPLibs instead of locally. Also some reordering in the !Mk files in
  order to work with current versions of Zap.
Admin:
  Builds against TCPIPLibs 5.47. Note that this version of the USB sources
  also now requires TCPIPLibs 5.47.
