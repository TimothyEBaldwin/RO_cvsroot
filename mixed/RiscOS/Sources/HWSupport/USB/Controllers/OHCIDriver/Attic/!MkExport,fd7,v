@Edits to build as a separate component
Detail:
  Makefile recreated.
  Removed USBHAL switched code.
  Pulled out BSD support functions into a new file (bsd_fns.c), and made DebugLib filter naming consistent.
  Changed ohci_base address to hci_base to allow commonality, though this isn't (yet) made use of.
  Expanded tabs in CMHG file.
Admin:
  Tested in a Tungsten ROM.
  Submission for USB bounty.

Version 0.49. Tagged as 'OHCIDriver-0_49'
