@Misc housekeeping
Detail:
  Makefile, !MkDebug,fd7 - Debug version of module can now be built just by passing "DEBUG=TRUE" to amu
  c/cmodule, c/musb_hal - Only accept USB controllers if HAL_USBControllerInfo says the struct size is an exact match with what we expect
  s/bufman - Delete unused file
  s/call_veneer, s/triggercbs - Use Entry/EXIT macros to avoid single-reg LDM/STM performance warnings. Convert tabs to spaces.

log
@Update to work with zero page relocation. Remove ability to cancel transfers by pressing escape
Detail:
  c/cmodule - Rework driver init/shutdown code to avoid null pointer dereference during Service_PreReset/USBDriver_Dying
  c/port - Removed ability to cancel transfers by pressing escape. Too dangerous for things like mass storage devices, and the code won't work anyway for the common case of being in the wimp
  s/triggercbs - Try using OS_ReadSysInfo 6 to get IRQsema ptr before falling back on legacy address
