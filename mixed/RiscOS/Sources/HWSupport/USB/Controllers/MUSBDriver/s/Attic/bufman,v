log
@Misc housekeeping
Detail:
  Makefile, !MkDebug,fd7 - Debug version of module can now be built just by passing "DEBUG=TRUE" to amu
  c/cmodule, c/musb_hal - Only accept USB controllers if HAL_USBControllerInfo says the struct size is an exact match with what we expect
  s/bufman - Delete unused file
  s/call_veneer, s/triggercbs - Use Entry/EXIT macros to avoid single-reg LDM/STM performance warnings. Convert tabs to spaces.
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM
