@Internationalised
Detail:
  Add support for standalone messages registration, and actually use the messages rather than just exporting them in ROM builds.
  Changed to use allocated error bases rather than 0.
  Sync with other HC for ease of comparison where possible.
Admin:
  Submission for USB bounty.
  Tested on a BBxM.
