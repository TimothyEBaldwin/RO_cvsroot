log
@Add support for HAL builds of MUSBDriver
Detail:
  Makefile - Now builds a HAL-compatible static library during the export libs phase
  !MkHAL,fd7 - Handy script for building the HAL lib
  c/musb_hal - HAL version of cmodule.c
  c/musb, c/musb_debug, c/musb_peri, c/musb_root, c/musb_usb, c/musb_util, c/tps, h/cmodule, h/musb, h/musb_util, h/tps - Changed to support the HAL build. Biggest change was getting rid of all global vars; everything is now done via the bus ptr instead.
  c/port - Removed microtime and moved riscos_irq_clear here, to match change made in main USB drivers
Admin:
  HAL & non-HAL versions tested on rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook
  Needs latest Kernel & NetBSD USB drivers
