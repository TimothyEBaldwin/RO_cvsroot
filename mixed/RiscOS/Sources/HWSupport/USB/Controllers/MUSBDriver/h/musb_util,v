@Add support for HAL builds of MUSBDriver
Detail:
  Makefile - Now builds a HAL-compatible static library during the export libs phase
  !MkHAL,fd7 - Handy script for building the HAL lib
  c/musb_hal - HAL version of cmodule.c
  c/musb, c/musb_debug, c/musb_peri, c/musb_root, c/musb_usb, c/musb_util, c/tps, h/cmodule, h/musb, h/musb_util, h/tps - Changed to support the HAL build. Biggest change was getting rid of all global vars; everything is now done via the bus ptr instead.
  c/port - Removed microtime and moved riscos_irq_clear here, to match change made in main USB drivers
Admin:
  HAL & non-HAL versions tested on rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook
  Needs latest Kernel & NetBSD USB drivers

@Restructure MUSBDriver source code, rework host mode endpoint handling, plus other misc changes
Detail:
  c/musb_debug - New file containing debug code.
  c/musb_peri - Contains the code for handling peripheral mode, taken from c/musb
  c/musb_root - Contains the code for handling the USBDriver-required 'soft' hub, taken from c/musb
  c/musb_usb - Contains initialisation code and other misc USBDriver-related code, mostly taken from c/musb
  c/musb_util - Misc utility functions from c/musb
  h/musb_util, h/musb_usb - A couple of new header files to help with breaking things up. Might make sense to break h/musb_usb down further (or just consolidate everything back into h/musb)
  c/musb - Stripped out pretty much everything except code related to host-mode endpoint and interrupt handling. Instances of the new musb_multiplexer struct are used to handle endpoint allocation, and allocation is now performed on a per-usbd_xfer basis instead of on a per-pipe basis. This should allow the code to cope better with situations where the number of pipes is greater than the number of physical endpoints, although much work is still required.
  c/cmodule, c/port, c/tps, h/cmodule, h/musb - Misc tweaks and changes
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM.
