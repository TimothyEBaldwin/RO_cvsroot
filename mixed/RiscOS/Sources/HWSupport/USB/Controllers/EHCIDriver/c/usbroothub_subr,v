@Edits to build as a separate component
Detail:
  Makefile created.
  Removed USBHAL switched code.
  Pulled out BSD support functions into a new file (bsd_fns.c), and made DebugLib filter naming consistent.
  Changed ehci_base address to hci_base to allow commonality, though this isn't (yet) made use of.
  Expanded tabs in CMHG file.
Admin:
  Tested in an OMAP4 ROM.
  Submission for USB bounty.
