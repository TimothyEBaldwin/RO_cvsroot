  Remove duplicated libs from debug build
  Remove relative reference to NetBSD component from VPATH

@Misc housekeeping
Detail:
  Makefile, !MkDebug,fd7 - Debug version of module can now be built just be passing "DEBUG=TRUE" to amu
  c/cmodule - Only accept USB controllers if HAL_USBControllerInfo says the struct size is an exact match with what we expect
  c/dwc_otg_riscos - Remove incorrect comment; both dwc_dma_alloc and malloc_contig zero memory
  s/bufman - Delete unused file
  s/call_veneer, s/triggercbs - Use Entry/EXIT macros to avoid single-reg LDM/STM performance warnings. Convert tabs to spaces.
Admin:
  Tested in BCM2835 ROM

@Add initial version of DWCDriver - USB driver for Synopsys DWC OTG controllers
Detail:
  A fairly simple wrapper for Synopsys's open source "DWC_otg" Linux driver, based around a GPL-free version of the DWC_otg 2.90a sources received from the Raspberry Pi foundation.
  Instead of interfacing with the Linux USB stack a new host interface layer has been implemented to allow it to talk to the standard BSD-derived RISC OS stack.
  RTSupport is used to provide the threading functionality that the DWC driver relies upon.
  Interesting files:
  - c/cmodule, h/cmodule - Main module frontend
  - c/dwc_common_riscos, h/dwc_common_riscos - Implementation of the OS support layer required by the DWC driver
  - c/dwc_otg_riscos, h/dwc_otg_riscos - Core code for the BSD driver implementation, driver init/shutdown, and for handling calls from the DWC host driver to us
  - c/port - Some support functions required by BSD-style code inherited from the other USB drivers
  - c/softc_device - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to attached USB devices
  - c/softc_root - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to the controller root hub
  - dwc/doc/* - Original Synopsys release notes & user guide pdfs
  - dwc/driver/*, dwc/dwc_common_port/* - Synopsys code and documentation. A few tweaks were required to allow it to compile under Norcroft, but otherwise it's functionally equivalent to the original sources.
Admin:
  Tested in BCM2835 ROM
  There are a few loose ends still to tidy up (search for "DWCTODO"), mainly regarding implementation of Isochronous support, but otherwise the driver seems stable enough for daily use.
