@Update to 'FIQ FSM' USB driver
Detail:
  Makefile, dwc/* - Updated to latest-ish code from Raspberry Pi github (rev c8baa9702c). Includes the 'FIQ FSM' USB driver, which replaces the older 'FIQ fix'. Note that many files appear to have no functional changes - just trailing whitespace removal to keep things in sync with github.
  Makefile - add DEBUGLIBS back into the debug libs listing to fix debug builds
  c/cmodule - Update to work with new FIQ FSM flags
  c/dwc_otg_riscos - Update to work with new FIQ FSM flags. Update initialisation procedure. Change IRQ handling to try both the HCD & CIL interrupt handlers (HCD can claim interrupt is handled when there's still a CIL interrupt pending). Disable support for falling back to IRQ if the FIQ vector is claimed by someone else - will need new implementation to cope with starting & stopping the FIQ FSM.
  s/regaccess - Update FIQ veneer & install routine to allow operation with either the dwc_otg_fiq_fsm or dwc_otg_fiq_nop functions.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1 & 2

@Update to version 3.00 of DWC_otg
Detail:
  This big batch of changes brings us in line with rev 70428950df of the Raspberry Pi Linux github.
  Briefly:
  * Deleted HTML docs as they're a waste of space
  * Dropped the SOF fix (which we never used anyway)
  * Dropped our implementation of the microframe scheduling patch, in favour of their implementation
  * Updated to version 3.00 of the DWC sources. Hard to tell what useful changes this brings, due to API tweaks resulting in pretty much every file being littered with changes.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  This new version seems like it might be a bit more sensitive to insufficient power supplies. Beware!

@Update to latest code from Raspberry Pi github. Improve debugging. Fix race condition that could lead to timeout callbacks inappropriately firing.
Detail:
  Makefile, dwc/* - Updated to latest code from Raspberry Pi github. Tweaks specific to Broadcom hardware have been placed in BCM2835 #ifdef's to allow them to easily be identified/controlled if we need the driver to support different SoCs in future
  c/cmodule, c/dwc_common_riscos, c/port, c/softc_device, h/cmodule - Improved debugging code
  c/softc_device - Schedule timeout before starting transfer instead of after. Fixes issue where a transfer that completes inbetween dwc_otg_hcd_urb_enqueue() and callout_reset() would result in the timeout being enabled even though the transfer is already complete
  s/triggercbs - Synced with latest USBDriver version for consistency
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  Fixes some, if not all, stability issues

@Add initial version of DWCDriver - USB driver for Synopsys DWC OTG controllers
Detail:
  A fairly simple wrapper for Synopsys's open source "DWC_otg" Linux driver, based around a GPL-free version of the DWC_otg 2.90a sources received from the Raspberry Pi foundation.
  Instead of interfacing with the Linux USB stack a new host interface layer has been implemented to allow it to talk to the standard BSD-derived RISC OS stack.
  RTSupport is used to provide the threading functionality that the DWC driver relies upon.
  Interesting files:
  - c/cmodule, h/cmodule - Main module frontend
  - c/dwc_common_riscos, h/dwc_common_riscos - Implementation of the OS support layer required by the DWC driver
  - c/dwc_otg_riscos, h/dwc_otg_riscos - Core code for the BSD driver implementation, driver init/shutdown, and for handling calls from the DWC host driver to us
  - c/port - Some support functions required by BSD-style code inherited from the other USB drivers
  - c/softc_device - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to attached USB devices
  - c/softc_root - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to the controller root hub
  - dwc/doc/* - Original Synopsys release notes & user guide pdfs
  - dwc/driver/*, dwc/dwc_common_port/* - Synopsys code and documentation. A few tweaks were required to allow it to compile under Norcroft, but otherwise it's functionally equivalent to the original sources.
Admin:
  Tested in BCM2835 ROM
  There are a few loose ends still to tidy up (search for "DWCTODO"), mainly regarding implementation of Isochronous support, but otherwise the driver seems stable enough for daily use.
