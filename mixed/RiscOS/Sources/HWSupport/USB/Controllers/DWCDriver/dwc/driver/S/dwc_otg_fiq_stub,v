log
@Update to 'FIQ FSM' USB driver
Detail:
  Makefile, dwc/* - Updated to latest-ish code from Raspberry Pi github (rev c8baa9702c). Includes the 'FIQ FSM' USB driver, which replaces the older 'FIQ fix'. Note that many files appear to have no functional changes - just trailing whitespace removal to keep things in sync with github.
  Makefile - add DEBUGLIBS back into the debug libs listing to fix debug builds
  c/cmodule - Update to work with new FIQ FSM flags
  c/dwc_otg_riscos - Update to work with new FIQ FSM flags. Update initialisation procedure. Change IRQ handling to try both the HCD & CIL interrupt handlers (HCD can claim interrupt is handled when there's still a CIL interrupt pending). Disable support for falling back to IRQ if the FIQ vector is claimed by someone else - will need new implementation to cope with starting & stopping the FIQ FSM.
  s/regaccess - Update FIQ veneer & install routine to allow operation with either the dwc_otg_fiq_fsm or dwc_otg_fiq_nop functions.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1 & 2


Version 0.21. Tagged as 'DWCDriver-0_21'
