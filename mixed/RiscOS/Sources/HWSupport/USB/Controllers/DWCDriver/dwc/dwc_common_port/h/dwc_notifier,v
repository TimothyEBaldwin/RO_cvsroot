@Update to version 3.00 of DWC_otg
Detail:
  This big batch of changes brings us in line with rev 70428950df of the Raspberry Pi Linux github.
  Briefly:
  * Deleted HTML docs as they're a waste of space
  * Dropped the SOF fix (which we never used anyway)
  * Dropped our implementation of the microframe scheduling patch, in favour of their implementation
  * Updated to version 3.00 of the DWC sources. Hard to tell what useful changes this brings, due to API tweaks resulting in pretty much every file being littered with changes.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  This new version seems like it might be a bit more sensitive to insufficient power supplies. Beware!

/** @@file
 *
 * A simple implementation of the Observer pattern.  Any "module" can
 * register as an observer or notifier.  The notion of "module" is abstract and
 * can mean anything used to identify either an observer or notifier.  Usually
 * it will be a pointer to a data structure which contains some state, ie an
 * object.
 *
 * Before any notifiers can be added, the global notification manager must be
 * brought up with dwc_alloc_notification_manager().
 * dwc_free_notification_manager() will bring it down and free all resources.
 * These would typically be called upon module load and unload.  The
 * notification manager is a single global instance that handles all registered
 * observable modules and observers so this should be done only once.
 *
 * A module can be observable by using Notifications to publicize some general
 * information about it's state or operation.  It does not care who listens, or
 * even if anyone listens, or what they do with the information.  The observable
 * modules do not need to know any information about it's observers or their
 * interface, or their state or data.
 *
 * Any module can register to emit Notifications.  It should publish a list of
 * notifications that it can emit and their behavior, such as when they will get
 * triggered, and what information will be provided to the observer.  Then it
 * should register itself as an observable module. See dwc_register_notifier().
 *
 * Any module can observe any observable, registered module, provided it has a
 * handle to the other module and knows what notifications to observe.  See
 * dwc_add_observer().
 *
 * A function of type dwc_notifier_callback_t is called whenever a notification
 * is triggered with one or more observers observing it.  This function is
 * called in it's own process so it may sleep or block if needed.  It is
 * guaranteed to be called sometime after the notification has occurred and will
 * be called once per each time the notification is triggered.  It will NOT be
 * called in the same process context used to trigger the notification.
 *
 * @@section Limitiations
 *
 * Keep in mind that Notifications that can be triggered in rapid sucession may
 * schedule too many processes too handle.  Be aware of this limitation when
 * designing to use notifications, and only add notifications for appropriate
 * observable information.
 *
 * Also Notification callbacks are not synchronous.  If you need to synchronize
 * the behavior between module/observer you must use other means.  And perhaps
 * that will mean Notifications are not the proper solution.

@Add initial version of DWCDriver - USB driver for Synopsys DWC OTG controllers
Detail:
  A fairly simple wrapper for Synopsys's open source "DWC_otg" Linux driver, based around a GPL-free version of the DWC_otg 2.90a sources received from the Raspberry Pi foundation.
  Instead of interfacing with the Linux USB stack a new host interface layer has been implemented to allow it to talk to the standard BSD-derived RISC OS stack.
  RTSupport is used to provide the threading functionality that the DWC driver relies upon.
  Interesting files:
  - c/cmodule, h/cmodule - Main module frontend
  - c/dwc_common_riscos, h/dwc_common_riscos - Implementation of the OS support layer required by the DWC driver
  - c/dwc_otg_riscos, h/dwc_otg_riscos - Core code for the BSD driver implementation, driver init/shutdown, and for handling calls from the DWC host driver to us
  - c/port - Some support functions required by BSD-style code inherited from the other USB drivers
  - c/softc_device - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to attached USB devices
  - c/softc_root - Code to handle requests from the BSD layer to the controller root hub
  - dwc/doc/* - Original Synopsys release notes & user guide pdfs
  - dwc/driver/*, dwc/dwc_common_port/* - Synopsys code and documentation. A few tweaks were required to allow it to compile under Norcroft, but otherwise it's functionally equivalent to the original sources.
Admin:
  Tested in BCM2835 ROM
  There are a few loose ends still to tidy up (search for "DWCTODO"), mainly regarding implementation of Isochronous support, but otherwise the driver seems stable enough for daily use.
