log
@  Initial import of PHCIDriver

Detail:
  The driver is currently fairly limited.  It sets up the hardware, and
supplies some * commands.

  It has been commited primarily for TestTask to make use of

Admin:
  Tested with TestTask on a STB, and quite extensively on a RiscPC.  The
* command PHCIDevDesc has been observed to put the chip into a confused state
after something of the order of 1000 repeats.
