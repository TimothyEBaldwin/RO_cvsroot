@  - Support added for overcurrent detection
  - Code added for supporting device side of controller
  - Better error detection and recovery

Detail:
  Analogue overcurrent detection has been switched on in the hardware
configuration.

  Code has been added to support the device side of the controller, although
this is by default switched out.  It hasn't been tested, but is included for
completeness.

  Error recovery is now much more robust and there is now an assembly option
to add a null packet to the end of the payload buffer.  This prevents
multiple transaction attempts on interrupt endpoints.

Admin:
  Tested extensively on a RiscPC.  The device controller code has been tested
at all (but isn't by default included).

@  - Fix to control transfers
  - Clarification of root hub interrupts
  - Error returns from USB Requests

Detail:
  Control transfers weren't properly counting the data portion across
multiple frames.  This is now properly counted.

  Root hub interrupts were only being turned on during reads.  They are now
on for the duration of the stream being open.

  If a control transfer fails during device call &80000000 (USB Request) then
the completion code is returned with an error message.

Admin:
  Tested on a STB and RiscPC.  It has been impossible to find a setting
of FSLargestDataPacket which is mutually compatible for full speed and low
speed devices.  Most low speed devices work with the setting &800 but some
mice appear not to, and only start working if the setting is changed to
&2000, however then printing stops working.

@  Much more functional driver.

Detail:
  The driver now implements a root hub, and can support interrupt, bulk and
control transfers.  Connections are made by opening the phci device in
devicefs with a special field specifying the endpoint number and type.

  DevDesc has been enhanced to print out on the command line if no address is
given.

Admin:
  Tested extensively on RiscPC and STB.  Still awaiting the writing of a
Spec.

@  Initial import of PHCIDriver

Detail:
  The driver is currently fairly limited.  It sets up the hardware, and
supplies some * commands.

  It has been commited primarily for TestTask to make use of

Admin:
  Tested with TestTask on a STB, and quite extensively on a RiscPC.  The
* command PHCIDevDesc has been observed to put the chip into a confused state
after something of the order of 1000 repeats.
