1.2
log
@  Much more functional driver.

Detail:
  The driver now implements a root hub, and can support interrupt, bulk and
control transfers.  Connections are made by opening the phci device in
devicefs with a special field specifying the endpoint number and type.

  DevDesc has been enhanced to print out on the command line if no address is
given.

Admin:
  Tested extensively on RiscPC and STB.  Still awaiting the writing of a
Spec.

log
@  Initial import of PHCIDriver

Detail:
  The driver is currently fairly limited.  It sets up the hardware, and
supplies some * commands.

  It has been commited primarily for TestTask to make use of

Admin:
  Tested with TestTask on a STB, and quite extensively on a RiscPC.  The
* command PHCIDevDesc has been observed to put the chip into a confused state
after something of the order of 1000 repeats.
