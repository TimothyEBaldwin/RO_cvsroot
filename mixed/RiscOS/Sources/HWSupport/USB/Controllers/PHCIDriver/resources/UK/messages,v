@  - Fix to control transfers
  - Clarification of root hub interrupts
  - Error returns from USB Requests

Detail:
  Control transfers weren't properly counting the data portion across
multiple frames.  This is now properly counted.

  Root hub interrupts were only being turned on during reads.  They are now
on for the duration of the stream being open.

  If a control transfer fails during device call &80000000 (USB Request) then
the completion code is returned with an error message.

Admin:
  Tested on a STB and RiscPC.  It has been impossible to find a setting
of FSLargestDataPacket which is mutually compatible for full speed and low
speed devices.  Most low speed devices work with the setting &800 but some
mice appear not to, and only start working if the setting is changed to
&2000, however then printing stops working.

@  Much more functional driver.

Detail:
  The driver now implements a root hub, and can support interrupt, bulk and
control transfers.  Connections are made by opening the phci device in
devicefs with a special field specifying the endpoint number and type.

  DevDesc has been enhanced to print out on the command line if no address is
given.

Admin:
  Tested extensively on RiscPC and STB.  Still awaiting the writing of a
Spec.

log
@  Initial import of PHCIDriver

Detail:
  The driver is currently fairly limited.  It sets up the hardware, and
supplies some * commands.

  It has been commited primarily for TestTask to make use of

Admin:
  Tested with TestTask on a STB, and quite extensively on a RiscPC.  The
* command PHCIDevDesc has been observed to put the chip into a confused state
after something of the order of 1000 repeats.
