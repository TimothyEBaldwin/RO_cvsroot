@Clear up duplicate/unused OHCI/EHCI source files
Detail:
  Remove the (now) unused sources from when this component produced multiple targets. See Controllers/OHCIDriver & Controllers/EHCIDriver for the live copies.
  Remove unset USBHAL defines.
  Simplify the Makefile and !Mk* scripts.
  No longer export usbroothub_subr.h.
  Add a porting type "device_t" to usb_port.h.
Admin:
  Submission for USB bounty.

1.1
log
@  Support for SCSISoftUSB, and some tidying up.
Detail:
  * Errors now use the allocated error number base, &819000, instead of a
    base in the private range, &50000000. "USB transfer failed" errors now
    have use a sub-range of error numbers from &819020; the original BSD
    error number can be retrieved from the bottom 5 bits of the RISC OS
    error number.
  * Service_USB 1 now returns the list in the order in which the devices,
    rather than in the reverse order as previous versions of the module did.
  * A little tweaking of h/usb_port to reduce compiler warnings.
  * Some compiler-satisfying changes to allow use of packed structures.
    (However, the compiler doesn't seem to work correctly yet, so this is
    currently switched out using -DDISABLE_PACKED on the command line.)
  * Added full stops to end of star command help strings for consistency
    with rest of OS.
  * New exports: USBDevFS (moved here from ^.h) and a few files in dev/usb/h
    and sys/h.
Admin:
  Error number overhaul and new exports are both required by SCSISoftUSB.
