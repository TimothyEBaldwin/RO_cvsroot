@Remove OHCIDriver & EHCIDriver as targets
Detail:
  Makefile and !Mk* updated, and corresponding unused files put in the attic.
  Add an interim OHCIHALLib and EHCIHALLib target so that the HAL library variant still builds.
  Split messages into CmdHelp and Messages per a normal C component.
  Remove unused wsconsio/wsmousevar porting headers, no longer used.
Admin:
  Submission for USB bounty.
  Note, the version number of the resulting module will jump to match the top level VersionNum file.

@Messages fixes, internationalisation, minor clean ups
Detail:
  USBDriver was performing unnecessary messages file reopening on Service_ResourceFSStarted (MessageTrans does this itself), remove this.
  Internationalised USBDriver, in particular its *Commands.
  Fixed standalone builds to output the messages file objects in the right place (Makefile mistake).
  Changed OHCIDriver and EHCIDriver to use allocated error bases rather than 0.
  Sync'd, where possible, the OHCIDriver and EHCIDriver sources which share a common heritage. Tentative shared interrupt support fixes for non-PCI attached controllers. Comment blocks & indentation improved.
  Export min() macro in usb_port.h.
  CMHG updated to not listen for unwanted services.
Admin:
  Submission for USB bounty.
  Tested on Pandaboard and Pi 2. OHCIDriver untested but low risk.

@Rework USB driver makefile & cmhg files to avoid constant rebuilds of USBDriver.h
Detail:
  Limitations in the way CMHG was being told which message file to use meant that the makefile was constructed in a way that would automatically delete usbmodhead.h/.o after they were built, to protect against OHCIDriver or EHCIDriver causing the file to be built referencing the wrong messages file.
  However since each component uses a unique messages filename, and each component has its own CMHG file, there was absolutely no need for this - all that was needed was to update the CMHG files to reference the correct messages file directly.
  ROM builds are now a minute or two faster because of this, which is quite welcome since I can often find myself doing 30+ builds a day.
Admin:
  Tested by building Tungsten ROM and diffing new modules against old; no differences detected.
