1.4
log
@         changes and bug fixes that came to light following USB2 launch.
Detail:
         - VarVal launching.. string length was incorrectly calculated.
         - USB VarVals now correctly cleared if device failed during
           enumeration, after first SetVarVal call.
         - Triggercbs() modified to check interrupt context and be
           refuse (quietly) to trigger callbacks if interrupts threaded
           (result of possible issue .. but perhaps wise)
         - Added third QueryDelay variable, and an Info file to describe
           what does what.
Admin:
         checked at Castle.. due for extended check via beta test site
         before formal release.

         Castle + D Ellis added IP

1.2
log
@  Support for SCSISoftUSB, and some tidying up.
Detail:
  * Errors now use the allocated error number base, &819000, instead of a
    base in the private range, &50000000. "USB transfer failed" errors now
    have use a sub-range of error numbers from &819020; the original BSD
    error number can be retrieved from the bottom 5 bits of the RISC OS
    error number.
  * Service_USB 1 now returns the list in the order in which the devices,
    rather than in the reverse order as previous versions of the module did.
  * A little tweaking of h/usb_port to reduce compiler warnings.
  * Some compiler-satisfying changes to allow use of packed structures.
    (However, the compiler doesn't seem to work correctly yet, so this is
    currently switched out using -DDISABLE_PACKED on the command line.)
  * Added full stops to end of star command help strings for consistency
    with rest of OS.
  * New exports: USBDevFS (moved here from ^.h) and a few files in dev/usb/h
    and sys/h.
Admin:
  Error number overhaul and new exports are both required by SCSISoftUSB.

@Import of USB driver suitable for generic PCI based OHCI controllers.
Correction of spelling of busses to buses (noun plural).

the device is of class OHCI controller.
