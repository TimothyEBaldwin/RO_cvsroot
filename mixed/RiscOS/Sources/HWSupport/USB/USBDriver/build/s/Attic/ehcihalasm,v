@Clear up duplicate/unused OHCI/EHCI source files
Detail:
  Remove the (now) unused sources from when this component produced multiple targets. See Controllers/OHCIDriver & Controllers/EHCIDriver for the live copies.
  Remove unset USBHAL defines.
  Simplify the Makefile and !Mk* scripts.
  No longer export usbroothub_subr.h.
  Add a porting type "device_t" to usb_port.h.

@  Fix HAL breakages caused by HAL_USBPortPower calls
Detail:
  In version 1.05, the USB library which is exported for the use of the HAL
  keyboard scan code unconditionally required the HAL_USBPortPower symbol.
  Not all HALs provide that entry point; for those that didn't, they would
  no longer link. Fixed by use of a bit of magic assembler.
Admin:
  Verified that OMAP3 ROM now builds again.
