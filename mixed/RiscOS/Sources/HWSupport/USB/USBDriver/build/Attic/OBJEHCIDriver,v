@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Remove some of the proliferation of !Mk[stuff] files due to lack of
relevance.
Combined the OBJ[target] listings into the main makefile with a switch.
Remove a spurious # from the EHCIMessages.

@Add the ability to build the USB drivers as HAL-compatible static libraries
Detail:
  build/Makefile, build/OBJEHCIDriver, build/OBJOHCIDriver, build/OBJUSBDriver - Modified makefiles to build the HAL libs during the export libs phase
  build/!MkHAL,fd7 - Handy script for building the HAL libs
  build/Hdr/usbhal - Header containing definitions for the assembler code. Also gets exported so that HALs know how much workspace to reserve.
  build/c/usbhal - HAL version of usbmodule.c & port.c. Also contains the keyboard scan code, adapted from the code in the Tungsten HAL.
  build/s/porthal - Assembler versions of some port.c routines that were easier to do in assembler than C
  build/s/halheap - OS_Heap code that's been adapted for use in the HAL. Could easily be changed into a standalone library instead of being part of the HAL USB libs. Supports memory-efficient allocation of aligned blocks.
  build/c/ehcihal - HAL version of ehcimodule.c. Currently only supports EHCI controllers exposed via HAL_USBControllerInfo (i.e. no PCI support)
  build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule, build/c/port - Moved riscos_irq_clear into port.c. Removed unused microtime() function.
  build/c/usbmouse - Strip out some debug-related code in non-debug builds
  build/Version - Updated version numbers
  dev/usb/c/ehci, dev/usb/h/ehcivar - Adapted to add support for the HAL build. Apart from the base changes, the code has also been tweaked to significantly reduce the amount of memory used at runtime by the HAL version of the driver.
  dev/usb/c/hid, dev/usb/c/uhub, dev/usb/c/usb, dev/usb/c/usb_quirks, dev/usb/c/usb_subr, dev/usb/c/usbdi, dev/usb/c/usbdi_util, dev/usb/c/usbroothub_subr - Changes to support HAL builds. Mainly disabling bits that won't work in the HAL or disabling bits for RISC OS in general if they weren't being used in the first place.
  dev/usb/c/ohci, dev/usb/h/ohcivar - Basic changes to support HAL builds. However HAL OHCI support is still incomplete.
  dev/usb/h/usb_port - Added support for the HAL build. Also tweaked logprintf definition to get rid of logprintf calls entirely in non-debug builds.
  dev/usb/h/usbdivar - Added support for the HAL build.
  dev/usb/h/usbhal - New header used by the HAL build. Gets included by every C file to ensure the compiler doesn't use sb, and contains structs/macros to allow access to the shared workspace.
Admin:
  HAL & non-HAL builds tested on rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook.
  Non-HAL builds tested with Iyonix ROM softload.
  Needs latest Kernel source for OSEntries.h export.

@Update EHCI driver to NetBSD latest (as of 10/07/2010), improve DeviceFS interface
Detail:
  EHCI driver update:
    dev/usb/c/ehci - Updated to latest NetBSD version, except for revisions 1.134 and 1.135 which are too invasive to merge in without updating the rest of the USB stack. This new version brings lots of bug fixes, and adds (untested on RISC OS) support for EHCI isochronous transfers.
    dev/usb/h/ehcivar - Updated to latest NetBSD version, except for the sc_bus splitting that was held back from the ehci.c update
    dev/usb/h/usb, dev/usb/h/usbdi, dev/usb/usbdivar - partial update to latest as required/possible
    dev/usb/c/usb_quirks, dev/usb/h/ehcireg, dev/usb/h/usb_mem, dev/usb/h/usb_quirks, dev/usb/h/usbhid, dev/usb/usbdevs, dev/usb/devlist2h.awk, dev/wscons/h/wsconsio, dev/wscons/h/wsmousevar - Updated to latest NetBSD versions
    dev/usb/c/usbroothub_subr, dev/usb/h/usbroothub_subr - New files brought in from NetBSD sources for use with new EHCI driver
    build/objehcidriver - Added usbroorhub_subr to EHCI driver
    dev/usb/h/usb_port - Added extra dummy functions as required by new EHCI driver
    dev/build/c/port - Added extra parameter to callout_init as required by new EHCI driver
  DeviceFS improvements:
    build/c/usbmodule - Added DeviceFSCallDevice_GetHandles2 as a replacement for Thomas Milius's backwards-incompatible GetHandles changes. Added DeviceFSCallDevice_GetSetOptions call to control RX padding and TX force-short-xfer features. These features can also be controlled at endpoint creation time by new fields in the filename. Also fixed packet padding to not fill the buffer with garbage or potentially crash when the padded area is more than one packet in length.
  New bus registration API:
    Changes made to the data structures that are shared between the modules means that new checks are needed to ensure USB modules with incompatible APIs are not used with one another.
    build/h/usbdivar - Since this seems to be the file containing the main structures that are shared, it now has a #define at the top indicating the first version of the USBDriver module that implemented the data structures within. This version number is used to check that the driver modules are compatible.
    build/cmhg/usbmodhead, build/h/usbdriver, build/c/usbmodule - Add a new SWI, USBDriver_Version, to return the version number of the USBDriver module. Used for both intra-stack API version checks and can be useful for external code that wants to query DeviceFS feature availability.
    build/c/usbmodule, build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule - Updated USBDriver_RegisterBus SWI and the code that calls it to pass the API version number (as defined in usbdivar.h) to USBDriver when attempting to reigster the bus. USBDriver then ensures the version matches that of itself, and if not refuses to allow the bus to register. EHCI & OHCI modules also check that USBDriver is new enough to implement this behaviour via the USBDriver_Version SWI.
  And finally:
    build/version - Incremented module version numbers.
    build/doc/usb - Updated with details of new features
Admin:
  Tested in ROM softload on Iyonix & beagleboard. Beagleboard hub issues seem to be resolved, and there are no new bugs that I can see.

@        Update of EHCIDriver to current NetBSD, together with needed changes
        in both OHCIDriver and USBDriver.


Detail:
        Code may change before formal release .. will be beta released
        ... Entered to CVS to get new version numbers, and for
        the record.
Admin:
        Castle/netbsd added IP .. will be tested more fully before
        formal release. Still to be verified on Rhenium.
