@Case change to match documentation
Detail:
  DeRegisterBus->DeregisterBus. Since clients calling this SWI are compiled C or assembler, this doesn't affect existing modules which remain binary compatible.
Admin:
  Submission for USB bounty.

@Add support for HC with hardware enumerate phase
Detail:
  Support controllers such as the XHCI which perform some steps of enumeration themselves in hardware, thereby needing some steps of the software enumeration to be bypassed.
  usb.c:
    Internally permit addr of 0, to represent the root hub, since the controller is responsible for allocating 1+. Merged from NetBSD 1.144.
  usb_subr.c:
    Test pointers against NULL not 0. Merged from NetBSD 1.191.
    Add 4 new bus methods, for prior to enumeration, address assignment phase, post enumeration fixup, and device removal.
  usbdivar.h:
    Prototypes of 4 new bus methods.
Admin:
  HC API version number bumped.
  Submission from Elesar.

@Add some missing struct members
From NetBSD dev/usb/usbdivar.h 1.109.
As these extra members change the struct layout, bump the API version number too. Having carefully analysed which headers are actually required by host controllers (in NetBSD-0_98) also be explicit about them in Hdr/USBDriver rather than the former vague comment in h/usbdivar.

Hdr/USBDriver:
  Relocate API define here.
usbmodule.c:
  Include USBDriver.h to get the API define.
usbdivar.h:
  Add struct members from recent NetBSD.

log
@Export USBDriver definitions to normal location
USBDriver was not exporting its SWI (and other) definitions to the export directory like other modules do, meaning the host controller drivers all have to reach into this component to get their hands on it.
Makefile:
  Export an assembler header, conversion to C, and SWI definitions from CMHG.
  Rationalise the dev/usb/h/* headers which are exported in addition to those that are pertinent to host controllers (was missing usbdivar, and was exporting unused usbdi_util).
  Export machine/h/bus too.
  As it's unusual for a CModule to output both a library and module and headers, the EXPDIR has been divided into EXPLIBDIR for those things in C:USB, and EXPDIR for the others.
ehcimodule.c/ohcimodule.c:
  Use the exported USBDriver.h
