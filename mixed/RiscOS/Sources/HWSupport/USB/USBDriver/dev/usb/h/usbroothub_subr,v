@Update EHCI driver to NetBSD latest (as of 10/07/2010), improve DeviceFS interface
Detail:
  EHCI driver update:
    dev/usb/c/ehci - Updated to latest NetBSD version, except for revisions 1.134 and 1.135 which are too invasive to merge in without updating the rest of the USB stack. This new version brings lots of bug fixes, and adds (untested on RISC OS) support for EHCI isochronous transfers.
    dev/usb/h/ehcivar - Updated to latest NetBSD version, except for the sc_bus splitting that was held back from the ehci.c update
    dev/usb/h/usb, dev/usb/h/usbdi, dev/usb/usbdivar - partial update to latest as required/possible
    dev/usb/c/usb_quirks, dev/usb/h/ehcireg, dev/usb/h/usb_mem, dev/usb/h/usb_quirks, dev/usb/h/usbhid, dev/usb/usbdevs, dev/usb/devlist2h.awk, dev/wscons/h/wsconsio, dev/wscons/h/wsmousevar - Updated to latest NetBSD versions
    dev/usb/c/usbroothub_subr, dev/usb/h/usbroothub_subr - New files brought in from NetBSD sources for use with new EHCI driver
    build/objehcidriver - Added usbroorhub_subr to EHCI driver
    dev/usb/h/usb_port - Added extra dummy functions as required by new EHCI driver
    dev/build/c/port - Added extra parameter to callout_init as required by new EHCI driver
  DeviceFS improvements:
    build/c/usbmodule - Added DeviceFSCallDevice_GetHandles2 as a replacement for Thomas Milius's backwards-incompatible GetHandles changes. Added DeviceFSCallDevice_GetSetOptions call to control RX padding and TX force-short-xfer features. These features can also be controlled at endpoint creation time by new fields in the filename. Also fixed packet padding to not fill the buffer with garbage or potentially crash when the padded area is more than one packet in length.
  New bus registration API:
    Changes made to the data structures that are shared between the modules means that new checks are needed to ensure USB modules with incompatible APIs are not used with one another.
    build/h/usbdivar - Since this seems to be the file containing the main structures that are shared, it now has a #define at the top indicating the first version of the USBDriver module that implemented the data structures within. This version number is used to check that the driver modules are compatible.
    build/cmhg/usbmodhead, build/h/usbdriver, build/c/usbmodule - Add a new SWI, USBDriver_Version, to return the version number of the USBDriver module. Used for both intra-stack API version checks and can be useful for external code that wants to query DeviceFS feature availability.
    build/c/usbmodule, build/c/ehcimodule, build/c/ohcimodule - Updated USBDriver_RegisterBus SWI and the code that calls it to pass the API version number (as defined in usbdivar.h) to USBDriver when attempting to reigster the bus. USBDriver then ensures the version matches that of itself, and if not refuses to allow the bus to register. EHCI & OHCI modules also check that USBDriver is new enough to implement this behaviour via the USBDriver_Version SWI.
  And finally:
    build/version - Incremented module version numbers.
    build/doc/usb - Updated with details of new features
Admin:
  Tested in ROM softload on Iyonix & beagleboard. Beagleboard hub issues seem to be resolved, and there are no new bugs that I can see.


Version 0.52. Tagged as 'NetBSD-0_52'
