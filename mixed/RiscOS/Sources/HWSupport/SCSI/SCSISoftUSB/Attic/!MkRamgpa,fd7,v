log
@Correct case sensitive compare never matching
In the module post init service call handler SCSIdriver -> SCSIDriver. While a caseless compare would also solve this, the only disc loading copy in RO5x0Hook loads the disc based SCSIDriver first anyway, so there's always a matched set there (as in ROM). Remove unused module post final service call handler too.
module.c: adjust case, remove unused code
modhdr.cmhg: remove unused service call table entry
glue.c: adjust case (of debug/comments)
Makefile: simplified given recent shared makefile improvements, notably the debug flags are now picked up from CDFLAGS/CMHGDFLAGS based on the target
!MkDebug/!MkRam: pass in the target for which the obey file relates rather than 'all'
