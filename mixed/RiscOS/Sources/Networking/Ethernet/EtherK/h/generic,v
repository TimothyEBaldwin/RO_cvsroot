1.1
log
@  Restructure and tidy up.
Detail:
  This version has no functional changes, but has been considerably
  tidied up to improve commenting and modularity. In particular the
  information printing routines, filtering routines and message
  logging routines have been split out into separate source files.
  The filtering routines have also been re-worked to be more
  comprehensible. Hopefully this will provide a useful base for
  developing future network drivers.
Admin:
  Requires an up-to-date version of BuildSys to build all variants.
  Basic testing indicates it still works, but more long term testing
  to confirm that nothing has been accidentally broken is required.


Version 0.12. Tagged as 'EtherK-0_12'
