log
@  Update BSD-derived code to version 1.7.35 of the FreeBSD driver sources.
  Rewrite and improve test code.
Detail:
  if_em.c, if_em_hw.c, if_em.h, if_em_hw.h and if_em_osdep.h have all
  been updated to version 1.7.35 of the FreeBSD sources. This version of
  the FreeBSD source tarball is now in the Original directory and earlier
  ones have been removed. The main effect of the changes is to add support
  for later Intel controllers. Note that workaround code required to
  support the 82544 when running on a PCIX bus, and to support the 82547EI
  has not been included to remove unnecessary complication. If support for
  these controllers is ever required (unlikely), this would need to be
  added back in.
  The test code has been rewritten and is now in a new file, test.c.
  Loopback code from the Linux driver is located in the loopback.c file
  and can optionally be compiled in by changing the #define at the top of
  test.c, but since this is GPL code it cannot be included in any
  distributed module. Also, although the test will work, it does not
  restore everything correctly so the link stays down afterwards until the
  module is reinitialised.
  AutoSense/EtherK has been updated to recognise all supported cards.
  doc/UserGuide has been updated.
Admin:
  Basic testing has been carried out, but more testing is required.
  Note that the updated AutoSense and UserGuide files need to be
  included in future distributions including this module.

1.1
log
@  Restructure and tidy up.
Detail:
  This version has no functional changes, but has been considerably
  tidied up to improve commenting and modularity. In particular the
  information printing routines, filtering routines and message
  logging routines have been split out into separate source files.
  The filtering routines have also been re-worked to be more
  comprehensible. Hopefully this will provide a useful base for
  developing future network drivers.
Admin:
  Requires an up-to-date version of BuildSys to build all variants.
  Basic testing indicates it still works, but more long term testing
  to confirm that nothing has been accidentally broken is required.
