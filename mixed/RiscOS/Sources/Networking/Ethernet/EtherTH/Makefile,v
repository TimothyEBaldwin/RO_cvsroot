@Build fix
Export our platform specific EtherDevice header, it's very tightly coupled to EtherTH.
Fix C exports too - was erroring trying to find $(HDR).
Manually tested in an exports phase.

# By default, the shared makefiles assume you want to use CMHG to create
# your module header. This is how to override it:
CMHGFILE =

# Header export phase
ASMHDRS   =
ASMCHDRS  =
HDRS      =
OBJS     = module

# CModule is equally useful for assembler modules. Its advantages over the
# AAmModule makefile are that you can use multiple source files (permitting
# more encapsulation, which is good programing practice) and it allows you
# to use non-postion-independent code, provided you do BL __RelocCode early
# in module initialisation.
