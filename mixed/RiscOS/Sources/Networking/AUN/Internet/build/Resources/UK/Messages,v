log
@Have Internet look after its own messages
Remove faulty logic for Service_MessageFileClosed, MessageTrans reopens the file, so no need to do it again locally.
Usual register/deregister/reregister code for ResourceFS.
Sort the SWI veneers into order, add veneers for ResourceFS in the RAM case.

Version 5.61. Tagged as 'Internet-5_61'
