4.1
log
@* Fixed bug introduced by tentative ARP probe - a typo made arp_ifinit() fail to
  set up the interface route structure properly.
* Divide-by-zero when an IGMP membership query with a time of 1 received fixed
  (from FreeBSD).
* IGMP messages now sent with TOS set to "maximum reliability".
* tcp_output.c updated from FreeBSD - in particular path_mtu_discovery sysctl
  now available.
* A few other FreeBSD structural changes and bug fixes integrated.
* Put UDP checksum in BOOTP packets.
* Null pointer dereferencing fixed in whoami.c. Address setting now done with
  SIOCDIFADDR and SIOCAIFADDR. Don't set the netmask if asked not to.
* Output BOOTP packets with the source address in ciaddr
Note that various structural changes mean that the support tools (in particular
InetStat) will need to be recompiled.
Requires TCPIPLibs 5.20

Version 5.27. Tagged as 'Internet-5_27'
