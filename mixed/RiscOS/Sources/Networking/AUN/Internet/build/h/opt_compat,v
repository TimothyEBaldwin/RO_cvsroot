4.1
log
@Added new FreeBSD sysctl handling using linker magic.
A few new sysctls added as a result.
SO_TIMESTAMP now gives real time, not Internet's internal time.
DHCP/BOOTP parsing picks up URL option and pops it into Inet$URL.
Requires TCPIPLibs 5.25 and link 5.12.

Version 5.31. Tagged as 'Internet-5_31'
