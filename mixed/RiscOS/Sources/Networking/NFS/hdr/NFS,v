log
@Export our own SWIs as a header
Use the shared makefiles to export Interface/NFS.h and Hdr:NFS.
Remove local copy NFS.h which confuses the dependency checking, now called nfsheaders.h instead.
Delete unused UID/GID pair.
Tested on a mount from FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE-p4.

Version 3.23. Tagged as 'NFS-3_23'
