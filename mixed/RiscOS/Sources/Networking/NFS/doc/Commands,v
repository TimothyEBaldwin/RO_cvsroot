@Here is a description of the *-commands which NFS provides:


*NFS
  Takes no parameters

*Logon

  *Logon [-Host <hostname>] <username> [<password>]
        -Host <hostname>        Chooses this host as the name server for this
                                  and subsequent name requests.
        <username>              The user whose details are to be obtained from
                                  the name server.
        <password>              The user's password. If not given the user will
                                  be prompted for this.

  *Logon -Host <hostname>
        This sets the host for subsequent name requests.

  *Logon nobody
        This sets the user name to 'nobody' (a well defined UNIX concept).

  *Logon
        This displays the current user name.

*Mount

  *Mount [-Host <hostname>] <mountname> [<mount path>]
        -Host <hostname>        Chooses this host as the NFS server for this
                                  and subsequent mount requests.
        <mountname>             Specifies the name this mount point shall be
                                  referred to in the RISC OS world. The files
                                  accessed via this mount point will always be
                                  accessed using the details of the user which
                                  was current at the time the *Mount command
                                  was executed. The URD, CSD, PSD and Lib
                                  are set to $ on this mount.
        <mount path>            Specifies the directory on the NFS server which
                                  shall act as $ on NFS::<mountname>.

  *Mount -Host <hostname>
        This lists all mount points on this host. The details given are the
          mountname and mount path and the user name for each mount point.

  *Mount
        This lists all mount points. The details given are the host name, the
        mountname, then mount path and the user name.

*Dismount

  *Dismount <mountname>
        This dismounts the given mount point. Files open on this mount point
          get closed.

  *Dismount -Host <hostname>
        This dismounts all mount points mounted on the given host. Files
          on this host get closed.

  *Dismount
        This dismounts all mount points. All NFS files get closed.

*TimeOffset

  *TimeOffset <number>
        This sets the time offset in minutes from GMT to local time. This is used
        when interpreting the server's date stamps which are assumed to be in GMT.

*CacheTime

  *CacheTime <number>
        This sets the time which information cached in the future is assumed to be
        valid for. The units are 1/100ths of a second.

These commands operate as do there equivalents in other filing systems:
*Back   *Bye    *Free   *NoDir  *NoLib  *NoUrd  *URD


There is this system variable, which controls the access given to created files
if none is given:
NFS$CreateAccess
This is interpreted as a decimal number, which gives the read and write mode bits.                
It is not essential that this variable be set.
