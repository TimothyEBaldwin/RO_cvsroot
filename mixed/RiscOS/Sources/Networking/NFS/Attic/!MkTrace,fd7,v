@  Fixed potential use of uninitialised pointer.
Detail:
  If the LOOKUP remote procedure chose not to supply the optional
    object attributes in its result, the attribute pointer would
    remain uninitialised and be treated as safe to use.  This can
    no longer occur.
  All but the unused static rcsid variable compile warnings removed.
Admin:
  Requires AsmUtils 0.06 or later.
  Requires Library 0.39 or later (for rpcgen 0.03 or later)
  Built and tested on Risc PC.

log
@  Attribute cacheing preload bug fixed.
  Debugging all switched to DebugLib-style.
Detail:
  The attribute cache preloading was failing to take effect because
    the hash value generation was giving the attribute cache preload
    function different answers to those it gave any other functions.
    This has now been fixed.
  Debugging support replaced completely by DebugLib support.
  The automatically generated RPC veneers do not contain any debugging
    (although it could be added by rpcgen - a beta version of rpcgen
    exists that writes DebugLib veneers into the stubs to note all RPC
    calls made via the stubs.  These functions do not, however, unpack
    the parameters and return structures yet.  That would be a massive
    job, requiring changes to all hand-written XDR functions - rpcgen
    could arrange to generate appropriate stuff for anything it writes,
    though)
  Removed obsolete db.c and db.h files.
  TaskObey script added to build the debugging version of the module.
Admin:
  This module has been tested on desktop machines for several months.
    The massive speedup expected from the use of NFS protocol version 3
    is now being noticed on directory operations,
