4.1
log
@  Access permission code overhaul.
  Supplementary group code improved.
Detail:
  *NFSInfo now shows the group names as well as the group IDs for
    both your primary and supplementary GIDs.
  access.c now uses the supplementary GIDs to help determine whether
    or not you are allowed to read/write a file.
  access.c now provides the NFS->RISC OS attribute mapping - "Owner"
    attributes being UNIX's user/group access; "Public" being the
    UNIX other access.
  The end result of these changes should be that your access rights to
    any object on the NFS server should match those you would expect
    from a UNIX shell logged in with the same ACLs as those you get
    via PCNFS.
Admin:
  Tested on Risc PC.

Version 3.09. Tagged as 'NFS-3_09'
