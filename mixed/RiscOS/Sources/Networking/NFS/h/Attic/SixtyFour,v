@  Now supports NFS version 3.
Detail:
  All client-server calls now use the superior NFS3 protocol.
  This particularly benefits directory enumeration and *NFSInfo
    is now reporting 80%+ cache hit rates which is a significant
    improvement (over 5% better - some hosts report 85%+)
  Hashing algorithms improved to increase cache hits (the cache
    algorithm doesn't use parts of names after a comma, so that
    the hash value for !Run is the same as the hash value for
    !Run,feb - which helps the cache hit rate a lot).   Directory
    browsing on the desktop appears noticably faster too.
  The module now has the original protocol (.x) files defining
    the RPC protocols being used (NFS, mount, pcnfs, rquota)
    and uses them to generate header files, XDR implementations,
    and client stubs automatically, instead of having hand
    written versions.
  NFS workspace comes from a dynamic area where possible.
Admin:
  Supporting documentation:
    Acorn NFS Software Functional Specification (1215,250/FS)
    RFC1014, RFC1057, RFC1094, RFC1813
  Tested in several desktop machines for everyday use against
    both NFS2 and NFS3 servers.
  Requires rpcgen 0.01 or later
    (CVS source: Tools/Sources/rpcgen  tag: rpcgen-0_01 or later)
    (CVS binary: RiscOS/Library  tag: Library-0_19 or later)
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.13 or later
    (CVS: RiscOS/Sources/Lib/TCPIPLibs  tag: TCPIPLibs-5_13)
