1.1
log
@  New source code management arrangement for OSLib library.
Detail:
  RiscOS/Sources/ThirdParty/OSLib/Lib/OSLib contains a verbatim copy of the
  public release of OSLib. Also included here is a makefile to install OSLib
  into the RISC OS build structure duringthe export-hdrs and export-libs
  phases, moving files in the process so that minimal changes are required to
  components which previously used Acorn's internal variant os OSLib.
Admin:
  Limited testing carried out so far in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 6.90. Tagged as 'OSLib-6_90'
