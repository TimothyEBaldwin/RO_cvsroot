1.1
log
@  New source code management arrangement for OSLib library.
Detail:
  RiscOS/Sources/ThirdParty/OSLib/Lib/OSLib contains a verbatim copy of the
  public release of OSLib. Also included here is a makefile to install OSLib
  into the RISC OS build structure duringthe export-hdrs and export-libs
  phases, moving files in the process so that minimal changes are required to
  components which previously used Acorn's internal variant os OSLib.
Admin:
  Limited testing carried out so far in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 6.90. Tagged as 'OSLib-6_90'
@
text
@RISC OS Open is distributing an unmodified version of the public OSLib
library, even though the head RISC OS licence holder has traditionally used
a customised version of the library. For compatibility with this customised
version, the files installed in the Export directory retain the directory
structure of the customised version. This conversion is scripted so as to
simplify ongoing maintenance, and is performed during the export-hdrs and
export-libs build phases.

The latest version of OSLib can be obtained from
http://ro-oslib.sourceforge.net.
