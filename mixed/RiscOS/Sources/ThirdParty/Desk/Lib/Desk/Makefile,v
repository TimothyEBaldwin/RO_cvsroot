log
@Apply a patch to the Desk library during the export phase.
Patches over the two unaligned loads (found by looking for left shift 16
followed by right shift 16). Was causing OmniClient to abort on ARMv7.
Thanks to the moderator Philip Ludlam for permission to do this.

1.1
log
@  New source code management arrangement for Desk library.
Detail:
  RiscOS/Sources/ThirdParty/Desk/Lib/Desk contains a verbatim copy of the
  public release of Desk. This is the only version that is allowed to be
  distributed, according to a strict reading of the licence conditions.
  Also included here is a makefile to install Desk into the RISC OS build
  structure during the export-hdrs and export-libs phases, moving and
  renaming files in the process so that minimal changes are required to
  components which previously used Acorn's internal variant of Desk.
Admin:
  Limited testing carried out so far in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 3.2.5. Tagged as 'Desk-3_2_5'
