1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import on vendor branch for public releases of Desk library.
Detail:
  This is identical to the pre-built archive of Desk 3.2.5. In order to
  comply with the licence conditions, this must only be updated in line with
  further public releases of Desk issued by the official Desk moderator.
  Files required to integrate this with the RISC OS build environment are
  included on the trunk only.
Admin:
  Has received only brief testing in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 3.2.5. Tagged as 'Desk-3_2_5-import'
