@Add 2 extra wimp message structs, fix a heap corruption
Added Desk_message_deviceclaim and Desk_message_deviceinuse to Wimp.h (the message number was defined, but no convenience struct).
Fix a bug in Desk_MsgTrans_LoseFile which was passing the wrong pointer to MessagesTrans which then corrupted the heap by clearing a flag at the wrong place.

The latter fixes the report of OmniClient crashing https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/3545
which used the LoseFile function.
Changes fed back to !Desk maintainer, these are local patches in the meantime.

log
@  New source code management arrangement for Desk library.
Detail:
  RiscOS/Sources/ThirdParty/Desk/Lib/Desk contains a verbatim copy of the
  public release of Desk. This is the only version that is allowed to be
  distributed, according to a strict reading of the licence conditions.
  Also included here is a makefile to install Desk into the RISC OS build
  structure during the export-hdrs and export-libs phases, moving and
  renaming files in the process so that minimal changes are required to
  components which previously used Acorn's internal variant of Desk.
Admin:
  Limited testing carried out so far in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 3.2.5. Tagged as 'Desk-3_2_5'
