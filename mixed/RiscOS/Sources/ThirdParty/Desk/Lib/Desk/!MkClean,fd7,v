1.1
log
@  New source code management arrangement for Desk library.
Detail:
  RiscOS/Sources/ThirdParty/Desk/Lib/Desk contains a verbatim copy of the
  public release of Desk. This is the only version that is allowed to be
  distributed, according to a strict reading of the licence conditions.
  Also included here is a makefile to install Desk into the RISC OS build
  structure during the export-hdrs and export-libs phases, moving and
  renaming files in the process so that minimal changes are required to
  components which previously used Acorn's internal variant of Desk.
Admin:
  Limited testing carried out so far in a RISC OS ROM build.

Version 3.2.5. Tagged as 'Desk-3_2_5'
