@Add support for 4k & 64k colours
Also RGB and BGR variants.
An alternative approach to adding support would have been to delete all the > 8bpp code since there are only 16 colours to choose from in the choices dialogue and the handling of ANSI escape sequences only handles 256 colours max, so internally the sprite "z" could be kept as 8bpp max and OS_SpriteOp 52 used (instead of 34) to get the OS to do the transform into the current mode via a translation table.
However, since the 16bpp & 32bpp code already existed, and all colours are abstracted through set_colour(), extending that instead at least allows for future support of ANSI true colour escape sequences should someone wish to add that.
In modechange() just ask the OS for log2bpp rather than computing it from Desk_screen_bpp.
Deleted some confusing commented out calls that cause false matches when searching for terms in the sources.
Turn off "must be declared extern in header" warning so the real warnings can be seen. Fix a few of the easy warnings.
Updated the !Help file to remove defunct contact information, and attribute the various contributors.

log
@Various changes
MOVS pc,lr -> MOV pc,lr and no need to stack R12 for an APCS function.
Lokales echo -> Local echo in UK templates.
Menu capitalisation made Style Guide compliant.
Access serial blockdrivers from SerialDev: rather than <SerialDev$Path>.
Fix get_screen_address() to not overwrite a word of stack by asking for 2 variables but only allowing 1 returned.
Move 'logfile' writes to Wimp$ScrapDir.
Changed hardwired 256 buffers to use MAX_PATHLENGTH (but still set to 256).
Include paths changed from "Desk.Thing.h" to Unix style "Desk/Thing.h"
Added Internal32 to the checks for magic Internal & InternalPC block driver names.
Configs are now read from Choices: and written through <Choices$Write>, with the defaults being held inside the application until the choices are first written out.
Changed default choice of download dir to RamFS.
When reading the *DOSMAP settings, use <Wimp$Scrap>. Should really be changed to use the MimeMap - an exercise for the reader.
Spool files are now held in <Wimp$ScrapDir>.

1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Reconstructed IBM & ISO fonts from the AOF files using objasm
Renamed 'buffer.h' to 'serialbuff.h" to avoid name clash with 'buffer.h' on the OSLib search path.
Many minor fixups for missing function prototypes and implicit function types (now considered an error by the compiler).
Reimplemented Desk_Pane2_RemovePane(), based on what it probably should do as it's not in mainline !Desk.
Now builds and runs, if the Resources are copied in from an old binary distribution of !Connector.
