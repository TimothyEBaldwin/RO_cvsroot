@Makefile recreated from fragments
Reconstructed IBM & ISO fonts from the AOF files using objasm
Renamed 'buffer.h' to 'serialbuff.h" to avoid name clash with 'buffer.h' on the OSLib search path.
Many minor fixups for missing function prototypes and implicit function types (now considered an error by the compiler).
Reimplemented Desk_Pane2_RemovePane(), based on what it probably should do as it's not in mainline !Desk.
Now builds and runs, if the Resources are copied in from an old binary distribution of !Connector.

@Import of Connector terminal application
Special thanks to Andreas Zieringer for permission to publish his sources, and to Dr HIRANO Satoshi for the portions of HTerm that !Connector uses.
Also thanks to Hugo Fiennes and (the late) Chuck Forsberg for the RISC OS block drivers and ZModem protocol respectively.
Note that files
  attrib.h
  control.h
  font.h
  protocol.h
  rawfont.c
  xfont.c
  layer6.c
differ from the originals in Andreas' sources only in that they're using a conventionally worded BSD licence. The full source to the XCept application can be found
  http://src.gnu-darwin.org/ports/comms/xcept/works/XCept-2.1.2/xcept
The bitmap data files 'ibmfonts' and 'isofonts' are AOF objects currently (source lost).
The single function in TIMING.c has been rewritten to rationalise on 1 licence.
Unlikely to build.
