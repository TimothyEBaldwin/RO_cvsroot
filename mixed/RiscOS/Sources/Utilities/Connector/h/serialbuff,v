1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Reconstructed IBM & ISO fonts from the AOF files using objasm
Renamed 'buffer.h' to 'serialbuff.h" to avoid name clash with 'buffer.h' on the OSLib search path.
Many minor fixups for missing function prototypes and implicit function types (now considered an error by the compiler).
Reimplemented Desk_Pane2_RemovePane(), based on what it probably should do as it's not in mainline !Desk.
Now builds and runs, if the Resources are copied in from an old binary distribution of !Connector.
