@Import of Connector terminal application
Special thanks to Andreas Zieringer for permission to publish his sources, and to Dr HIRANO Satoshi for the portions of HTerm that !Connector uses.
Also thanks to Hugo Fiennes and (the late) Chuck Forsberg for the RISC OS block drivers and ZModem protocol respectively.
Note that files
  attrib.h
  control.h
  font.h
  protocol.h
  rawfont.c
  xfont.c
  layer6.c
differ from the originals in Andreas' sources only in that they're using a conventionally worded BSD licence. The full source to the XCept application can be found
  http://src.gnu-darwin.org/ports/comms/xcept/works/XCept-2.1.2/xcept
The bitmap data files 'ibmfonts' and 'isofonts' are AOF objects currently (source lost).
The single function in TIMING.c has been rewritten to rationalise on 1 licence.
Unlikely to build.
