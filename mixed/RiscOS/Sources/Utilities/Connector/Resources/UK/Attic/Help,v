I hope most of the program explains itself.

  Configuration
  ˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜
    Modem
    -----

      The modem init string will be send to the modem optinal on startup
      or if you select "Init modem" on the main menu.
      The dial prefix string + number + dial suffix string will be send
      to the modem while dialling a number.
      For hangup it's possible to send the hangup string or to drop
      DTR for one second.(this works only if you modem is
      configured to do this)

      "|W" waits one second
      "|M" return

    Terminal
    --------

    The insert/delete option for chat works only if both sides are using
    Connector.

    Serial Port
    -----------

    If you use a PC cable you should use the "InternalPC" driver,otherwise
    the "Internal" driver.


    Filetransfer
    ------------

      Filetype conversion
        syntax:extension of the filename space filetype number
        gif 695,pcx 697 ...


  If you turn on the "Save terminal status" option the actual status
  of terminaltype,baud rate,data,filetransfer type,spool speed,wrap mode,
  local echo,cr==>cr/lf,lf==>cr/lf,25 lines will be also saved.

    modem status,status line for autologon.
    Pressing the button on the left opens a serial information window.

  Main window
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    the adjust-button paste's the text out of the mousebuffer
    at the cursor position.
    double click selects a word.
    trible click selects a line.

    dragging an text-file in the main window paste's the text at
    the cursor position.
    dragging an data-file (with shift dragg all filetypes) in the main 
    window opens the spool window.

  Telephone Book
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    double click start's the connection.

    Script Files
  ------------

  The Syntax looks like this:

  REM Remark
  NAME     "what ever"    ;
  NUMBER   "1234564"      ; Telephone number
  TERMINAL VT102          ; VT102,ANSI,CHAT
  BAUD     19200
  DATA     8N1
  FILETR   ZModem <TX window size> <send crashrecovery> <ACK intervall> 
                  <receive crashrecovery|overwrite|rename>
           XModem <CRC|Checksum> <128 bytes|1024 bytes>
  WRAP     ON             ; ON,OFF
  ECHO     ON             ; ON,OFF
  25LINES  OFF            ; ON,OFF
  AVATAR   ON             ; turns ON/OFF the avatar emulation (only ANSI).
  ONLINE   120            ; max. online time(in minutes) default is
                          ; 0 = unlimited
  MODEMINIT ""            ; Init string for Modem
  DOWNLOAD  ""            ; own download directory
  ENDHEADER

  REM After "ENDHEADER" only SEND,WAIT,DIAL,REM, IF, IFN, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, 
  REM SET, INC, DEC, HANGUP, QUIT, WAITUNTIL can follow.

  WAITUNTIL 13.08.1997 11:59:40 ; waits until ....
  DIAL                          ; dials number
  WAIT 50                       ; waits 50 centiseconds
  WAIT "Login"                  ; waits for String
  SEND "topdog|M"               ; sends String
  WAIT "Password",600           ; waits for String but only 6 seconds
  SEND "xxxxxx|M"               ;
  
  REM This is just a demo ...
  
  loop:
  SET counter 10
  GOSUB do_this  
  DEC counter
  IF counter > 0 GOTO loop

  IFN WAIT "test",400 GOTO something_different
  SEND "Ok."
  GOTO the_end
  something_different:
  SEND "Not ok."

  the_end:
  
  END
  
  do_this:
  SEND "blub"
  RETURN
  
  The script commands are NOT case sensitive, but the variables and labels 
  are case sensitive.                             

  If you choose "New" in the telephone book window you get a window
  to enter all this things ... if you press save it generates this
  scriptfile so you don't need to know the SYNTAX.
  If you choose "Logon" it opens the scriptfile in an text editor,
  where you can edit the part under the DIAL command to autologon
  in a BBS.


  that's it, hope it helps.

@Import of Connector terminal application
Special thanks to Andreas Zieringer for permission to publish his sources, and to Dr HIRANO Satoshi for the portions of HTerm that !Connector uses.
Also thanks to Hugo Fiennes and (the late) Chuck Forsberg for the RISC OS block drivers and ZModem protocol respectively.
Note that files
  attrib.h
  control.h
  font.h
  protocol.h
  rawfont.c
  xfont.c
  layer6.c
differ from the originals in Andreas' sources only in that they're using a conventionally worded BSD licence. The full source to the XCept application can be found
  http://src.gnu-darwin.org/ports/comms/xcept/works/XCept-2.1.2/xcept
The bitmap data files 'ibmfonts' and 'isofonts' are AOF objects currently (source lost).
The single function in TIMING.c has been rewritten to rationalise on 1 licence.
Unlikely to build.
