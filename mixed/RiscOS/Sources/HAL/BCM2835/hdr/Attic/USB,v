@Don't bother providing even dummy implementations of USB port and overcurrent functions
As the flag bit in HAL_USBControllerInfo isn't set, no need to provide them.
Use symbols from Hdr:HALEntries when building the USB info.
Built, but not tested.

@Add support code required for DWCDriver 'FIQ fix'
Detail:
  hdr/BCM2835, hdr/USB, s/USB - Update HAL_USBControllerInfo to return the MPHI address & IRQ number
  s/Interrupts - Add some missing memory barriers. Change FIQ enable/disable calls to not alter IRQ masking of the interrupt - simplifies the code and avoids any ordering issues with code that switches interrupts between IRQ & FIQ
  s/Timers - Add missing memory barrier
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi
  Requires Kernel-5_35-4_79_2_227 to build

@Add USB support
Detail:
  hdr/USB - New header with definition of usbinfo struct that's used by HAL_USBControllerInfo
  hdr/BCM2835 - Add note clarifying how mailboxes are used
  s/Top - Enable power to USB on startup
  s/USB - Implement HAL_USBControllerInfo to expose Synopsys USB controller details to RISC OS
Admin:
  Tested in BCM2835 ROM with Apr 19th start.elf
