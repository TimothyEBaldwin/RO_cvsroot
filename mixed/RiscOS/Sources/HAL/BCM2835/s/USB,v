@Don't bother providing even dummy implementations of USB port and overcurrent functions
As the flag bit in HAL_USBControllerInfo isn't set, no need to provide them.
Use symbols from Hdr:HALEntries when building the USB info.
Built, but not tested.

@Add support code required for DWCDriver 'FIQ fix'
Detail:
  hdr/BCM2835, hdr/USB, s/USB - Update HAL_USBControllerInfo to return the MPHI address & IRQ number
  s/Interrupts - Add some missing memory barriers. Change FIQ enable/disable calls to not alter IRQ masking of the interrupt - simplifies the code and avoids any ordering issues with code that switches interrupts between IRQ & FIQ
  s/Timers - Add missing memory barrier
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi
  Requires Kernel-5_35-4_79_2_227 to build

@  SD support, and miscellaneous other changes
Detail:
  * Bugfix to HAL_FIQDisableAll - it wasn't clearing the FIQ register (would
    only have caused trouble in practice if the same device was subsequently
    enabled as an IRQ).
  * Added a load of memory barriers to s.Interrupts and s.Timers to conform
    to the requirement stated in 1.3 of the datasheet.
  * Added a HAL device for the Arasan SDHCI controller. Note that this does
    not currently work reliably, and results vary from card to card. High
    speed support is currently disabled until we are able to verify that it
    works reliably.
  * Added a sprinkling of "GET Hdr:ListOpts" because the space reserved for
    the SDHCI HAL device in hdr.StaticWS is determined by including
    Hdr:HALDevice and Hdr:SDHCIDevice, which need it.
  * When support for saving "CMOS" to the SD card is added, the ROM image
    file (kernel.img) is the only one we can count on the bootloader
    installing in memory, so I think we're going to have to work using the
    table in s.CMOS. Broadcom seems to like messing around with the space
    just after the processor vector table, so rather than adding a pointer
    to the table there, I've opted to mark it using a magic word.
Admin:
  Tested on a Raspberry Pi - as noted above, there are reliability issues.

@Sanitise HAL_USBControllerInfo
Detail:
  s/USB - For valid controllers, HAL_USBControllerInfo now always returns the correct USB struct size and fills in the controller type. The rest of the buffer is filled in only if the supplied size is large enough. This allows for proper probing of controllers without knowing the required buffer sizes beforehand.

@  Initial import of BCM2835 (Raspberry Pi) HAL
Detail:
  Covers the basic functionality, but does require a customised start.elf
  to function. The vast majority is an entirely new implementation and is
  BSD licenced, but 4% (the Makefile and a handful of simple macros) are
  copied from pre-existing Castle-licenced code, so it lives under the
  "mixed" hierarchy. If other HALs are anything to go by, we'll end up
  having to add more Castle code (at least some C runtime functions) so it's
  probably juast as well.
