@Implement HAL UART API. Tidy up debug output.
Detail:
  hdr/BCM2835, hdr/StaticWS, s/Debug, s/Top, s/Video - Fix up the two serial debug switches to work correctly. Disable debug by default.
  s/UART, hdr/UART - Implement HAL UART API, for the PL011 UART.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1 B
  Requires DualSerial 0.25 to work correctly

@  Whitespace changes
Detail:
  Substituted remaining hard spaces with normal ones and expanded tabs.
  This now matches the de facto standard for other components, and also looks
  better in the CVS web viewer.
Admin:
  No code changes

  Update of HAL to incorporate separate development of HAL by J Ballance
  Will now compile against initial developemnt start.elf, and against the
  start.elf in general release at this date. (compile switch UseALBlob in
  hdr.BCM2835). Extended header defs, Updated IRQ stuff, HAL_FramebufferAddress
  Reworked Timers, + a number of other bits. Still work in progress.
Detail:
  (list files and functions that have changed)
Admin:
  Compiled and working - as far as it goes -. Will enable use with the current
  start.elf, and is (subject to any minor changes introduced) ready for use with the
  version due for release shortly which will provide the correct transparency operation,
  and a better aligned frame buffer

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of BCM2835 (Raspberry Pi) HAL
Detail:
  Covers the basic functionality, but does require a customised start.elf
  to function. The vast majority is an entirely new implementation and is
  BSD licenced, but 4% (the Makefile and a handful of simple macros) are
  copied from pre-existing Castle-licenced code, so it lives under the
  "mixed" hierarchy. If other HALs are anything to go by, we'll end up
  having to add more Castle code (at least some C runtime functions) so it's
  probably juast as well.
