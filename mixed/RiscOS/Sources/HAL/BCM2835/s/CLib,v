1.1
log
@  SD support, and miscellaneous other changes
Detail:
  * Bugfix to HAL_FIQDisableAll - it wasn't clearing the FIQ register (would
    only have caused trouble in practice if the same device was subsequently
    enabled as an IRQ).
  * Added a load of memory barriers to s.Interrupts and s.Timers to conform
    to the requirement stated in 1.3 of the datasheet.
  * Added a HAL device for the Arasan SDHCI controller. Note that this does
    not currently work reliably, and results vary from card to card. High
    speed support is currently disabled until we are able to verify that it
    works reliably.
  * Added a sprinkling of "GET Hdr:ListOpts" because the space reserved for
    the SDHCI HAL device in hdr.StaticWS is determined by including
    Hdr:HALDevice and Hdr:SDHCIDevice, which need it.
  * When support for saving "CMOS" to the SD card is added, the ROM image
    file (kernel.img) is the only one we can count on the bootloader
    installing in memory, so I think we're going to have to work using the
    table in s.CMOS. Broadcom seems to like messing around with the space
    just after the processor vector table, so rather than adding a pointer
    to the table there, I've opted to mark it using a magic word.
Admin:
  Tested on a Raspberry Pi - as noted above, there are reliability issues.
