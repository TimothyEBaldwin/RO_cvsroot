@Added "Build directory" to the things you can do in the main window's menu.

You can now open the build directory from the main window's "View" submenu,
which complements the pre-existing functionality.

1.2
log
@  Build fix
Detail:
  Some users reported problems building the sources if they had other
  installations of perl on their build machine. The build system was using a
  mixture of "perl" and "<Perl$Dir>.perl" to invoke the interpreter, and
  sometimes but not always using "do" to expand system variables on the
  command line. This has now been standardised to use "do <Perl$Dir>.perl in
  all cases, and where possible, to use the makefile macro ${PERL}.
Admin:
  Checked that a Tungsten build still works on a build machine with no other
  perl installation. "perl" was aliased to an error to ensure it wasn't used.
