@  More wide-ranging changes to srcbuild for portability and romlinker.
Detail:
  The romlinker joiner format is now defined and implemented by srcbuild.
    This means that srcbuild can invoke romlinker to join main ROMs,
    expansion ROMs or extension ROMs depending on a switch in a product's
    components file (the %format directive should specify a value of one
    of rom extrom or exprom).
  Any %-directives that are not srcbuild directives are passed through to
    romlinker as command-line options.  All target image sizes are passed
    through in bytes - see romlinker documentation for full details of the
    interfaces.
  Environment variables are set to represent the territory mappings.  This
    is done on all targets so that other tools can rely on retrieving the
    information via getenv() and not needing to prod the International
    module directly.
  extern declarations removed from .c files into .h files to remove chance
    of mismatched multiple declarations.
  Some spelling corrections in comments, system call synchronisation calls
    added, although sb_system does not implement parallel makes yet.
  Documentation added on the portability aspects, environmental aspects and
    the territory mapping stuff.  A program is provided (MkDefaults) to
    run under RISC OS to generate up-to-date source code for srcbuild's
    territory information database.
  srcbuild now keeps note of the type of image that it is generating, rather
    than relying on reverse-engineering it from the joiner and joiner format
    strings (set by %format in the component file, defaults to main ROM)
  Many comments updated to reflect the actual code, some obsolete code
    removed.
Admin:
  This version should represent a functionally complete version capable of
    running cross-compiled builds on UNIX systems.
  Tested on RISC OS.

@  Portable version of srcbuild.
  Has initial knowledge of the romlinker tool - work incomplete.
Detail:
  This is a portable version of srcbuild.  It is no longer tied to various
    RISC OS concepts such as: global shared environment namespace;
    *Spool; . as directory separator (host's directory separator is read
    during program startup).
  UNIX version stores the "system variables" in a hash table and exports
    the contents of the environment hash table to new processes which it
    forks.  UNIX version does not parallelise builds currently - in theory
    with a little more intelligence in sb_system to manage the log file
    coherently, it should be possible to parallelise some actions during
    builds (because it will avoid blocking srcbuild when waiting for I/O,
    and because changing the environment in the parent srcbuild process
    won't affect any children that are still running)
  A lot of things have changed in this version - many functions have been
    renamed to avoid clashes with UNIX system calls (most calls in riscos.c
    in fact); printf/fprintf(stderr...) are no longer used directly -
    sb_printf/sb_fprintf is used instead to ensure data is copied to the
    log file.
  ROM joining works on Solaris if you supply the Install/<Build> directory
    fully populated with files from a RISC OS build which comprise the
    ROM image.  Identical images are produced (with: romlinker -format rom).
  This version of srcbuild cannot use romlinker to build anything other
    than ROM images - syntax for specifying expansion/extension images
    is yet to be implemented.  To test, set %Joiner and %JoinerFormat to
    romlinker in your Components file (and put romlinker in your library
    directory if you do not have a RiscOS/Library/Build which includes it)
  Removed some duplicated code that calculated ROM positions when an install_rom
    phase had not been run but a join had been requested - build_install_rom
    is now parameterised to enable the BBE generator, join phase and normal
    install_rom activities to be done by one function instead of three nearly
    identical bits of code.
  Anything other than list or join requires a compatible Makefile in each
    component in the build.
Admin:
  Tested, although not exhaustively, under RISC OS.
  Tested list & join phases on Intel Solaris.
  romlinker integration tested briefly.

@	* Initial support for multiple territories in one build.

Admin:
	For the Bethany project we need to be able to build multiple resource
(territory) sets into one ROM build. The system variable LocaleList is read
and, if set, is parsed for a comma-seperated list of countries. The resources
phase is then called once for each of these countries. If the LocaleList flag
is unset then is should build the territory as set in the Locale in the Env
file.
	If the LocaleList flag is set then after the resources phase has been
run there should be one directory in the Internet.Messages path for each
territory mentioned in the LocaleList.
	To allow this to work the Common and Env files also need altering. If
the Env file does not have a LocaleList then it should have en explicit Unset
LocaleList. The common file also needs to have every *Set that references
<Locale> to be changed to a *SetMacro.

Admin:
	Work in progress for Bethany project. Only partially tested. A binary
checkin will follow after more work and testing.
