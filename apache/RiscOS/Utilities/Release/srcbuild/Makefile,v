log
@  Now sets environment variables based upon options.
Detail:
  You can now rely on the options passed in the components file to
  adjust the "Locale", "UserIF" and "Machine" environment variables
  for a component. This allows you to build components which use
  paths like "LocalRes:", "LocalUserIFRes:" in their Makefiles and
  get the correct resources out.

  I also fixed the install rule in the Makefile.
Admin:
  Builds and quite thoroughly tested.

  As an aside, I do occasionally see data aborts during builds, but
  this has been seen for a couple of years and on various build
  machines. An example is:

  INSTDIR = 'ADFS::Slayer2.$.Builds.Baseline.InstallAMU: *** Internal
  error: abort on data transfer at &0380D278 ***

  (line split for clarity). I don't know if this is amu's fault or
  scrbuild not terminating strings correctly. This is always where
  things seem to fail, i.e. the Kernel outputting a string which
  aborts before reaching the terminator - at the byte which should
  be it. Maybe it is the OS_NewLine code triggers callbacks in a
  task window which occasionally causes some nasty abort?

1.14
log
@  Several little updates.
Detail:
  The RESDIR setting passed down to components is now fixed to be
    <Resource$Dir>.Resources for the first 64 components,
    <Resource$Dir>.Resources2 for the next 64,
    <Resource$Dir>.Resources3 for the next 64 etc.
    Currently most components explicitly override srcbuild's suggestion,
    but this is dangerous (could cause weird resource problems on old
    build machines).  64 chosen since it is comfortably less than 77.
  If a component appears twice in the components file(s), it is warned
    about.
  The default selection of image type (rom, exprom, extrom, other) is
    delayed until all components files are parsed - previously the choice
    would have been made at the end of any included file.
  BBE builds can cope with components that host multiple targets - notably
    the territory modules.  This used to fail previously (and required the
    entire sources of the component to be shipped) since only one target,
    the last to be processed, would be written into the BBE Makefile.
Admin:
  Tested briefly with various builds.

log
@  More wide-ranging changes to srcbuild for portability and romlinker.
Detail:
  The romlinker joiner format is now defined and implemented by srcbuild.
    This means that srcbuild can invoke romlinker to join main ROMs,
    expansion ROMs or extension ROMs depending on a switch in a product's
    components file (the %format directive should specify a value of one
    of rom extrom or exprom).
  Any %-directives that are not srcbuild directives are passed through to
    romlinker as command-line options.  All target image sizes are passed
    through in bytes - see romlinker documentation for full details of the
    interfaces.
  Environment variables are set to represent the territory mappings.  This
    is done on all targets so that other tools can rely on retrieving the
    information via getenv() and not needing to prod the International
    module directly.
  extern declarations removed from .c files into .h files to remove chance
    of mismatched multiple declarations.
  Some spelling corrections in comments, system call synchronisation calls
    added, although sb_system does not implement parallel makes yet.
  Documentation added on the portability aspects, environmental aspects and
    the territory mapping stuff.  A program is provided (MkDefaults) to
    run under RISC OS to generate up-to-date source code for srcbuild's
    territory information database.
  srcbuild now keeps note of the type of image that it is generating, rather
    than relying on reverse-engineering it from the joiner and joiner format
    strings (set by %format in the component file, defaults to main ROM)
  Many comments updated to reflect the actual code, some obsolete code
    removed.
Admin:
  This version should represent a functionally complete version capable of
    running cross-compiled builds on UNIX systems.
  Tested on RISC OS.

1.12
log
@  Portable version of srcbuild.
  Has initial knowledge of the romlinker tool - work incomplete.
Detail:
  This is a portable version of srcbuild.  It is no longer tied to various
    RISC OS concepts such as: global shared environment namespace;
    *Spool; . as directory separator (host's directory separator is read
    during program startup).
  UNIX version stores the "system variables" in a hash table and exports
    the contents of the environment hash table to new processes which it
    forks.  UNIX version does not parallelise builds currently - in theory
    with a little more intelligence in sb_system to manage the log file
    coherently, it should be possible to parallelise some actions during
    builds (because it will avoid blocking srcbuild when waiting for I/O,
    and because changing the environment in the parent srcbuild process
    won't affect any children that are still running)
  A lot of things have changed in this version - many functions have been
    renamed to avoid clashes with UNIX system calls (most calls in riscos.c
    in fact); printf/fprintf(stderr...) are no longer used directly -
    sb_printf/sb_fprintf is used instead to ensure data is copied to the
    log file.
  ROM joining works on Solaris if you supply the Install/<Build> directory
    fully populated with files from a RISC OS build which comprise the
    ROM image.  Identical images are produced (with: romlinker -format rom).
  This version of srcbuild cannot use romlinker to build anything other
    than ROM images - syntax for specifying expansion/extension images
    is yet to be implemented.  To test, set %Joiner and %JoinerFormat to
    romlinker in your Components file (and put romlinker in your library
    directory if you do not have a RiscOS/Library/Build which includes it)
  Removed some duplicated code that calculated ROM positions when an install_rom
    phase had not been run but a join had been requested - build_install_rom
    is now parameterised to enable the BBE generator, join phase and normal
    install_rom activities to be done by one function instead of three nearly
    identical bits of code.
  Anything other than list or join requires a compatible Makefile in each
    component in the build.
Admin:
  Tested, although not exhaustively, under RISC OS.
  Tested list & join phases on Intel Solaris.
  romlinker integration tested briefly.

@	Changed handling of amu_machine in srcbuild.

Details:
	Changed way in which srcbuild uses amu_machine to get around RISC OS
3.7 limitions on command line length.  Now expands amu_machine alias
internally, which means that long command lines in builds will now work
correcltly.

	Tidied build system to create and clean up its "o" folder correctly,
and to clean it's dynamic dependencies.

Admin:
	Tested on several Lazarus builds. Committed on behalf of JBeranek

@Summary
  *  Added support for install: targets
  *  Added support for podule ROM builds.

Detail
  *  Added support to pass 'install' as a valid parameter.  This allows
     disc builds and podule rom builds to be completed.
  *  Added knowledge of MakeExpROM as a valid joiner app.
Admin
  *  Tested install: work using a dummy Baseline 3 build.
  *  Tested MakeExpROM work using RiscOS/BuildSys/EtherI16E as a basis.
     srcbuild produces an indentical ROM to the old-style build system for
     populated roms and roms only containing podule ID information.

SrcBuild$ReturnCode		Whether the build was successful or not.

 Also altered the install phase to install the executable in library.build instead of library, making it install into the correct place for the new library structure.
 Altered the exit(1) calls to be exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
