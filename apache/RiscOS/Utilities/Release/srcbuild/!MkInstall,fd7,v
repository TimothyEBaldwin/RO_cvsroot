@  Now sets environment variables based upon options.
Detail:
  You can now rely on the options passed in the components file to
  adjust the "Locale", "UserIF" and "Machine" environment variables
  for a component. This allows you to build components which use
  paths like "LocalRes:", "LocalUserIFRes:" in their Makefiles and
  get the correct resources out.

  I also fixed the install rule in the Makefile.
Admin:
  Builds and quite thoroughly tested.

  As an aside, I do occasionally see data aborts during builds, but
  this has been seen for a couple of years and on various build
  machines. An example is:

  INSTDIR = 'ADFS::Slayer2.$.Builds.Baseline.InstallAMU: *** Internal
  error: abort on data transfer at &0380D278 ***

  (line split for clarity). I don't know if this is amu's fault or
  scrbuild not terminating strings correctly. This is always where
  things seem to fail, i.e. the Kernel outputting a string which
  aborts before reaching the terminator - at the byte which should
  be it. Maybe it is the OS_NewLine code triggers callbacks in a
  task window which occasionally causes some nasty abort?

log
@  More wide-ranging changes to srcbuild for portability and romlinker.
Detail:
  The romlinker joiner format is now defined and implemented by srcbuild.
    This means that srcbuild can invoke romlinker to join main ROMs,
    expansion ROMs or extension ROMs depending on a switch in a product's
    components file (the %format directive should specify a value of one
    of rom extrom or exprom).
  Any %-directives that are not srcbuild directives are passed through to
    romlinker as command-line options.  All target image sizes are passed
    through in bytes - see romlinker documentation for full details of the
    interfaces.
  Environment variables are set to represent the territory mappings.  This
    is done on all targets so that other tools can rely on retrieving the
    information via getenv() and not needing to prod the International
    module directly.
  extern declarations removed from .c files into .h files to remove chance
    of mismatched multiple declarations.
  Some spelling corrections in comments, system call synchronisation calls
    added, although sb_system does not implement parallel makes yet.
  Documentation added on the portability aspects, environmental aspects and
    the territory mapping stuff.  A program is provided (MkDefaults) to
    run under RISC OS to generate up-to-date source code for srcbuild's
    territory information database.
  srcbuild now keeps note of the type of image that it is generating, rather
    than relying on reverse-engineering it from the joiner and joiner format
    strings (set by %format in the component file, defaults to main ROM)
  Many comments updated to reflect the actual code, some obsolete code
    removed.
Admin:
  This version should represent a functionally complete version capable of
    running cross-compiled builds on UNIX systems.
  Tested on RISC OS.
