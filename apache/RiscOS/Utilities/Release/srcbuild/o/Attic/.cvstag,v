1.2
log
@  A handful of fixes to resolve problems introduced during recent work.
Detail:
  RESDIR is passed down as <Resource$Dir>.Resources (RISCOS) builds, as
    expanding the system variable causes command line buffer overflows
    in LazarusUI (without expansion the line is 249 bytes long - the
    limit is 255).
  Additionally, RESDIR is also passed as <path>/Resources - previously
    Resources was missing and resulted in the resources being exported
    to the wrong directories.
  Export.<APCS>.Lib is explicitly created (safety feature, because HdrSrc
    creates it anyway, but realistically it should be done here)
  Command-line buffer created during amu_machinef is now length checked
    to abort srcbuild if data has been overwritten.
Admin:
  Tested in Laz1UK build - fixes problems in earlier versions.

Version 0.29. Tagged as 'srcbuild-0_29'
