1.1
log
@Added "Build directory" to the things you can do in the main window's menu.

You can now open the build directory from the main window's "View" submenu,
which complements the pre-existing functionality.

Also squashed a whole slew of build warnings. This was some shoddy code...

Version 0.26. Tagged as 'builder-0_26'
