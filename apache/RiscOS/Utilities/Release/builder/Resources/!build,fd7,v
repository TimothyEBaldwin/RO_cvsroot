@Added "Build directory" to the things you can do in the main window's menu.

You can now open the build directory from the main window's "View" submenu,
which complements the pre-existing functionality.

Also squashed a whole slew of build warnings. This was some shoddy code...

log
@  Build fix
Detail:
  Some users reported problems building the sources if they had other
  installations of perl on their build machine. The build system was using a
  mixture of "perl" and "<Perl$Dir>.perl" to invoke the interpreter, and
  sometimes but not always using "do" to expand system variables on the
  command line. This has now been standardised to use "do <Perl$Dir>.perl in
  all cases, and where possible, to use the makefile macro ${PERL}.
Admin:
  Checked that a Tungsten build still works on a build machine with no other
  perl installation. "perl" was aliased to an error to ensure it wasn't used.

@Summary
  * Improvements to Builder's version handling.
  * Improvements to debugging support.
Detail
  * Changed Builder to use DebugLib.
  * Builder is now capable of using DCotton's new image naming scheme.
    An extra set of Radio buttons for selecting the naming scheme has
    been added to the Options window.  The versioning scheme selected is
    saved in the defaults file.
Admin
  * Tested on ONC2UK build using both ImageName and NewImName scripts for
    versioning.
  * Assumes that NewImName will be checked into BuildSys/perl/ once
    completed.
