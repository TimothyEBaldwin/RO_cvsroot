@                                  !Builder
                                  --------

The application !Builder is a simple front end to the ROM building process. It
performs the following functions :

  * maintains a list of multiple build trees
  * provide menu access to environment files
  * menu click to edit current components file
  * menu click to edit master modules database
  * option button selection of phases of build to perform
  * saving of current options as default for next time
  * provide easy access to version number control

Notes/Requirements :

  * !Builder can be located in your Apps directory and can be shared across
    different build trees.
  * If !Builder is started with the command line argument "-quit", the default
    build directory and env file is sourced and the application is exited.
  * A new env file is sourced when the application started up and when a new
    environment is selected off the menu.
  * <Choices$Write> must point somewhere useful to save defaults.
  * <Build$Dir>.Env must contain all the environment files which in turn source
    the !Common environment file. Use the construct :
        Set Build$Dir      <Obey$Dir>
        <Build$Dir>.Library.canonical Build$Dir
    to remove the pesky ^ that can be found in the path. canonical can be found
    in the renaissa/Build/Library directory.
  * Module database must reside in directory <Build$Dir>.BuildSys.
  * The Components file should have the same name as the <Build> environment
    variable that is set in the Env file. These live in the directory
    <Build$Dir>.BuildSys.Components.
  * When the "Build" button on the main window is clicked, the file
    !Builder.!build is run with the appropriate command line options. This
    file can be customised to run other scripts to set for example build name
    environment variables.
  * The radio buttons for version number control pass fields to the imagename
    perl script which is used to set the Build$ImageName environement variable.


Update (Wed 25th August 1999) NBingham.

Builder now has the capability to build Disc Images and Podule Extension ROMs.
A new command line parameter for the components file allows -install <path> to
be passed in.  This *must* be in place before the -options switch.  -install
allows you to specify a subdirectory inside <install$dir>.<build> that the
component is installed to.  eg:

NCFresco     -install !STBBoot.Resources -options RES=alt

Requires srcbuild 0.15 or better.

@Summary
  * Added support for srcbuild 0.15
Detail
  * Added OptionButton in main window for 'Install RAM' that maps onto
    the install: target.
  * Added ability to open the 'Logs' and 'Images' directory from the View
    menu.
Admin
  *  Tested install: work using a dummy Baseline 3 build.
  *  Tested MakeExpROM work using RiscOS/BuildSys/EtherI16E as a basis.
     srcbuild produces an indentical ROM to the old-style build system for
     populated roms and roms only containing podule ID information.

  * button click to perform a build using currently ticked phases with the
    current environment.
    
Environment files are hidden away in the !Builder.Env directory. This directory
is scanned before the environment list menu is popped up and the filenames
appear in the menu. When a menu entry is clicked, that environement file is
Wimp_StartTask'ed, sourcing the contents of the file.

Clicking on the build button Wimp_StartTask's the file !Builder.!build. This
file is used to set an appropriate wimpslot and run any pre-build scripts that
could be used to configure build names etc. Finally, srcbuild is run with the
parameters specified in the !Builder window.
