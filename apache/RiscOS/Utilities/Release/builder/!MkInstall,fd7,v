@Added "Build directory" to the things you can do in the main window's menu.

You can now open the build directory from the main window's "View" submenu,
which complements the pre-existing functionality.

Also squashed a whole slew of build warnings. This was some shoddy code...

@Summary
  * Added support for srcbuild 0.15
Detail
  * Added OptionButton in main window for 'Install RAM' that maps onto
    the install: target.
  * Added ability to open the 'Logs' and 'Images' directory from the View
    menu.
Admin
  *  Tested install: work using a dummy Baseline 3 build.
  *  Tested MakeExpROM work using RiscOS/BuildSys/EtherI16E as a basis.
     srcbuild produces an indentical ROM to the old-style build system for
     populated roms and roms only containing podule ID information.
