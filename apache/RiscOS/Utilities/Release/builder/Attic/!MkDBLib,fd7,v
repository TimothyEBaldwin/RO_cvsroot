1.1
log
@Summary
  * Improvements to Builder's version handling.
  * Improvements to debugging support.
Detail
  * Changed Builder to use DebugLib.
  * Builder is now capable of using DCotton's new image naming scheme.
    An extra set of Radio buttons for selecting the naming scheme has
    been added to the Options window.  The versioning scheme selected is
    saved in the defaults file.
Admin
  * Tested on ONC2UK build using both ImageName and NewImName scripts for
    versioning.
  * Assumes that NewImName will be checked into BuildSys/perl/ once
    completed.
