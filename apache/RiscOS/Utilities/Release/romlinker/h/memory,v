@Add support for embedding debug symbols in ROM images
Detail:
  This change allows debug symbols (currently, just function names) to be embedded in ROM images, by having romlinker read the _syms and _gpa files that the shared makefiles copy to the install folder alongside each module.
  Basic compression techniques are used to try and keep the symbol table size manageable, e.g. the symbols for a Raspberry Pi ROM currently require 240k of space.
  The symbol table will be automatically discarded if there is insufficient space (e.g. IOMD), or if necessary the -nodebugsyms option can be used to prevent symbol table inclusion completely.
  File changes:
  c/symbols, h/symbols - Code for parsing the GPA & syms files and producing the compressed symbol table blob. Adapted from the ROM symbol loading functionality present in profanal (http://www.phlamethrower.co.uk/riscos/fiqprof.php)
  Makefile - Include symbols.c
  c/makerom - Add the -nodebugsyms option. Collect symbols for each component as it's loaded. Write out the symbol table after the module chain, and include the offset in the extended ROM footer.
  c/memory, h/memory - Add safe_realloc function
  docs/Notes - document -nodebugsyms option
Admin:
  Tested with Raspberry Pi, IOMD ROM builds

@Initial import of unified ROM joining tool.
  
This tool can generate standard RISC OS ROM images (superceding BigSplit2)
and expansion card ROM images (superceding MakeExpROM) and also extension
ROM images (for which no tool currently exists in our library repository).
  
All content of expansion and extension ROMs is assumed to be a module at
present - this will be fixed in the next version to enable sprites to be
used as well as loaders and other chunk entry types.
  
This tool is portable and has been tested on RISC OS, Intel Solaris and
SPARC Solaris and shown to produce identical output.
