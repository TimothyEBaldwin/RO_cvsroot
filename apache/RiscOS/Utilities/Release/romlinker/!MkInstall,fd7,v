1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of unified ROM joining tool.
  
This tool can generate standard RISC OS ROM images (superceding BigSplit2)
and expansion card ROM images (superceding MakeExpROM) and also extension
ROM images (for which no tool currently exists in our library repository).
  
All content of expansion and extension ROMs is assumed to be a module at
present - this will be fixed in the next version to enable sprites to be
used as well as loaders and other chunk entry types.
  
This tool is portable and has been tested on RISC OS, Intel Solaris and
SPARC Solaris and shown to produce identical output.
