1.2
log
@  New version of romlinker which implements its own joinerformat.
  Documentation on usage and implementation added.
Detail:
  Sprites can be added to extension ROMs/expansion card ROMs and get
    their chunks marked appropriately.
  No longer core dumps when -v or -via is the final CLI parameter.
  Gives help on supported formats when complaining that -format is
    missing or wrong.
  More common code abstracted out of the individual linkers.
Admin:
  Requires and required by srcbuild 0.27 or later (mutually dependent)
  Builds on RISC OS, Intel Solaris.
  Tested somewhat on RISC OS.

Version 0.01. Tagged as 'romlinker-0_01'

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of unified ROM joining tool.
  
This tool can generate standard RISC OS ROM images (superceding BigSplit2)
and expansion card ROM images (superceding MakeExpROM) and also extension
ROM images (for which no tool currently exists in our library repository).
  
All content of expansion and extension ROMs is assumed to be a module at
present - this will be fixed in the next version to enable sprites to be
used as well as loaders and other chunk entry types.
  
This tool is portable and has been tested on RISC OS, Intel Solaris and
SPARC Solaris and shown to produce identical output.
