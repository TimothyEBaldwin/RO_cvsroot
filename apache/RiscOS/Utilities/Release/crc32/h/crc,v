1.2
log
@  Added CRC-16 and BYTESUM-32 formats too.  Updated documentation.

Detail:
  Rename make_table() to make_tables() and have it generate tables for
  both CRC-16 and CRC-32.

  Add extra input/output parameter 'crc16' to update_crc() and have it
  calculate CRC-16 in parallel with CRC-32.

  Change result printing to report CRC-16 and BYTESUM-32 as well as existing
  CRC-32 and BYTESUM-16.  Output format is not backwards-parsable with old
  format, but there is no known code that parses it.

Admin:
  Built and tested with a couple of test files on RISCOS and Sparc Solaris.
