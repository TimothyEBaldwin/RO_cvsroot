@  Added CRC-16 and BYTESUM-32 formats too.  Updated documentation.

Detail:
  Rename make_table() to make_tables() and have it generate tables for
  both CRC-16 and CRC-32.

  Add extra input/output parameter 'crc16' to update_crc() and have it
  calculate CRC-16 in parallel with CRC-32.

  Change result printing to report CRC-16 and BYTESUM-32 as well as existing
  CRC-32 and BYTESUM-16.  Output format is not backwards-parsable with old
  format, but there is no known code that parses it.

Admin:
  Built and tested with a couple of test files on RISCOS and Sparc Solaris.

 *
 * Purpose: 
 *
 * This program generates Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) and Checksums of a
 * single file.
 *
 * These algorithms are useful for detecting data corruption when transferring 
 * a file through a medium that could possibly introduce errors, for example 
 * a network, floppy disk, CD-ROM etc.
 *
 * The particular application that this program is designed for is releasing
 * software (for example binary ROM images) to customers and manufacturing 
 * sites and for archiving such releases in the Drawing Office.  One of its
 * goals, therefore, is to be compatible with a variety of industry-standard 
 * algorithms such as those used by EPROM programmers to verify that devices
 * have been correctly programmmed with the intended images.
 *
 * The following algorithms are supported:
 *
 *   CRC-32	A standard CRC algorithm using the generator polynomial
 *		(x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 +
 *		 x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x^1 + 1) with pre- and post-
 *		conditions of -1.
 *
 *		This is a standard algorithm defined in ITU-T V.42 and
 *		reportedly used by Ethernet, FDDI, PKZip and PNG (RFC2083).
 *
 *   CRC-16 	A standard CRC algorithm using the generator polynomial 
 *		(x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1) with pre- and post-conditions of 0.
 *
 *		This is an older and weaker algorithm than CRC-32.  It
 *		is used by the RISCOS SWI OS_CRC.  
 *
 *   BYTESUM-32	A simple 32-bit checksum calculated by summing the data
 *		bytes mod 2^32.
 *
 *		This is the algorithm used by the DATA I/O programmer in
 *		the Pace Cambridge hardware lab.
 *
 *   BYTESUM-16 A simple 16-bit checksum calculated by summing the data
 *		bytes mod 2^16.  It is just the bottom 16-bits of the 
 *		BYTESUM-32, but is reported separately for convenience.
 *
 *		This algorithm is often used in simple self-test software.
 *		
 *
 * For a detailed description of CRC algorithms, see the paper "A Painless
 * Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms" by Ross N. Williams, available at
 * ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/clients/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt and in the "doc"
 * directory of this programme.
 *
 * Sample CRC-32 code similar to that used in this program is contained in 
 * an appendix of RFC 2083.
 *
 * History:
 *
 * dd-mmm-1995 JHarris - Created. 
 * dd-mmm-1997 RBuckley - Imported to CVS from Spinner SrcFiler.
 * 10-Nov-1999 JFarrell - Extended to produce various other CRCs and checksums.
