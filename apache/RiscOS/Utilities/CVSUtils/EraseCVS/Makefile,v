1.4
log
@  Rewrote the important part of this utility so it worked.
Detail:
  Endless dereferences of uninitialised points; strlen(NULL); etc.
    It's amazing it ever worked at all - perhaps it was just luck?
    Previous versions always used to just take my machine out with
    a nasty abort - hardly surprising given the code.
  The code no longer has to enumerate directories multiple times -
    it will thus execute faster now.
  Code no longer recurses with vast amounts of stacked data; static
    data requirements increased (24K of static buffers are used instead).
  This version now has a restriction that it won't work if the total length
     of all the leafnames in all the directories in any single complete
     root->leaf path exceeds 32768-N bytes (where N is the number of leafnames)
Admin:
  Tested.
