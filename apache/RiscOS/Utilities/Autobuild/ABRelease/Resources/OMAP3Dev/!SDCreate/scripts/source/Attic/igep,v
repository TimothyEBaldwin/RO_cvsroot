@Use SDCreate component instead of local copies of the tool
Detail:
  Resources/OMAP3Dev/release_autobuild,feb, Resources/OMAP4Dev/release_autobuild,feb - Take SDCreate from the <Install$Dir>.ABRelease folder instead of using local copies of the tool
  Resources/OMAP3Dev/!SDCreate, Resources/OMAP4Dev/!SDCreate - Deleted local copies of SDCreate
Admin:
  Tested with building and packaging OMAP3 ROM

@A few changes to make deciphering what's what easier.
For ROMs we essentially have IOMDHAL[Dev]; Tungsten[Dev]; OMAP3[Dev]; OMAP4Dev and for these it only makes sense to autobuild the Dev ones and offer them as softloads where there's an actual ROM chip to softload over. OMAP4Dev remains development status, IOMDHAL doesn't exist in stable form.
So:
 * IOMDHALDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * IOMDHAL - do not use at this time
 * OMAP3Dev - updated text docs to reflect CMOS use
 * OMAP3 - do not use at this time
 * TungstenDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * Tungsten - do not use at this time
 * OMAP4Dev - untouched
Removed references to !SCSIForm from InstallHD4 script.
Don't turn off alignment exceptions by default in InstallHD4 script.
Update RMEnsures to 5.19 for development.
Make readme's be non specific about the version to save updating them again.

@Update OMAP3 ROM autobuilder step to include !SDCreate in the ROM archive instead of a bunch of U-Boot scripts
Detail:
  Rather than running the risk of the user (or his OS) doing something wrong when creating SD card images from scratch, OMAP3 ROM images will now ship with the !SDCreate utility that presents the user with an easy-to-use WIMP frontend for creating and writing SD card images.
  For people without (working) RISC OS machines, the !SDCreate help file also contains enough information to allow them to set up a card manually, along with the source to the U-Boot scripts - so we're not really losing anything by deleting the old scripts folder.
Admin:
  Tested the release_autobuild stage on an OMAP3 ROM build, and everything seemed to be OK.
