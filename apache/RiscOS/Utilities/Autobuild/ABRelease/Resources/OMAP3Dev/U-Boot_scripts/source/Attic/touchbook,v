@Update OMAP3 ROM autobuilder step to include !SDCreate in the ROM archive instead of a bunch of U-Boot scripts
Detail:
  Rather than running the risk of the user (or his OS) doing something wrong when creating SD card images from scratch, OMAP3 ROM images will now ship with the !SDCreate utility that presents the user with an easy-to-use WIMP frontend for creating and writing SD card images.
  For people without (working) RISC OS machines, the !SDCreate help file also contains enough information to allow them to set up a card manually, along with the source to the U-Boot scripts - so we're not really losing anything by deleting the old scripts folder.
Admin:
  Tested the release_autobuild stage on an OMAP3 ROM build, and everything seemed to be OK.

Detail:
  The OMAP3Dev product now has its own custom release_autobuild script, which adds my U-Boot scripts and their source code to the zip file.
Admin:
  Tested with MkAuto script; seems to work OK!
