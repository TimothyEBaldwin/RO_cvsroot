@Update OMAP3 ROM autobuilder step to include !SDCreate in the ROM archive instead of a bunch of U-Boot scripts
Detail:
  Rather than running the risk of the user (or his OS) doing something wrong when creating SD card images from scratch, OMAP3 ROM images will now ship with the !SDCreate utility that presents the user with an easy-to-use WIMP frontend for creating and writing SD card images.
  For people without (working) RISC OS machines, the !SDCreate help file also contains enough information to allow them to set up a card manually, along with the source to the U-Boot scripts - so we're not really losing anything by deleting the old scripts folder.
Admin:
  Tested the release_autobuild stage on an OMAP3 ROM build, and everything seemed to be OK.

@RISC OS U-Boot scripts
----------------------

This folder contains the human-readable source to the boot scripts, along with a Unix shell script for converting the scripts to binary format using U-Boot's 'mkimage' tool.

Currently the scripts operate by entering the OMAP ROM image at different entry points - one entry point per machine type. From the entry point used, RISC OS is then able to determine the machine type that it is running on, and thus the correct parameters to use for initialising and communicating with peripherals. The table of entry points is listed below. New entries will only ever be added to the end; existing entries will no be moved/removed.

You can use the table below as a guide for creating your own scripts, or by choosing the right entry point when converting a RISC OS ROM image to a U-Boot uImage.


Machine type		Entry point
------------		-----------

BeagleBoard		ROM start + &00000000
DevKit8000		ROM start + &00000004
IGEPv2			ROM start + &00000008
Pandora			ROM start + &0000000C
Touch Book		ROM start + &00000010

Detail:
  The OMAP3Dev product now has its own custom release_autobuild script, which adds my U-Boot scripts and their source code to the zip file.

  Tested with MkAuto script; seems to work OK!
