@Bump up RAM disc size in InstallHD4 script
Too much stuff, no longer fits in 32MB while decompressing.
Also reads the source drive name rather than assuming hardwired 0.

@A few changes to make deciphering what's what easier.
For ROMs we essentially have IOMDHAL[Dev]; Tungsten[Dev]; OMAP3[Dev]; OMAP4Dev and for these it only makes sense to autobuild the Dev ones and offer them as softloads where there's an actual ROM chip to softload over. OMAP4Dev remains development status, IOMDHAL doesn't exist in stable form.
So:
 * IOMDHALDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * IOMDHAL - do not use at this time
 * OMAP3Dev - updated text docs to reflect CMOS use
 * OMAP3 - do not use at this time
 * TungstenDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * Tungsten - do not use at this time
 * OMAP4Dev - untouched
Removed references to !SCSIForm from InstallHD4 script.
Don't turn off alignment exceptions by default in InstallHD4 script.
Update RMEnsures to 5.19 for development.
Make readme's be non specific about the version to save updating them again.

@Replace !SDCreate with v1.02b. Add InstallHD4 script to help with setting up a !Boot sequence on OMAP machines.
Detail:
  Resources/OMAP3Dev/!SDCreate/!Help, !Run, !Desc - Updated to V1.02b. Only real change is to check for v1.28 of the FrontEnd module, since v1.16 was reported as not working.
  Resources/OMAP3Dev/InstallHD4,fe6, ReadMe.txt, release_autobuild,feb - Added InstallHD4 script, based around Trevor Johnson's script on the wiki
Admin:
  InstallHD4 script tested on BB-xM; seems to work!
