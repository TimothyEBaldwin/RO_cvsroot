@RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the iMx6 (Wandboard) development ROM image. It is a bleeding-edge
build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant sources in
our source code repository and is completely untested.

Using this ROM image in your board should only be done if you are confident
that you know what you are doing! It is likely to be functionally incomplete
and probably unstable in various ways.


IMPORTANT
=========

This build of RISC OS utilises "zero page relocation", a change to the
standard memory map which is designed to increase the stability of the OS and
your software. However, there is a catch - a lot of existing software is buggy,
and this change will expose those bugs, causing the software to crash.

To help with the transition to having zero page relocation enabled by default,
a compatibility/logging module called 'ZeroPain' has been developed. See the
readme file in the ZeroPain folder for more information. It is recommended that
you install the module before you install this new ROM image, otherwise you may
have difficulty booting your system.


How to install the ROM image
============================

The easiest way to install the ROM image onto an SD card is to use the
included !SDCreate application. If you have the RISC OS 5 USB mass storage
drivers then !SDCreate can write the image straight to an SD card.

Alternatively you can create a disc image file which can then be written to a
card using any ordinary Windows/Linux/Mac PC. For more information, including
a description of the SD card structure, see the !SDCreate help file.


CMOS RAM
========

The Wandboard doesn't include any CMOS memory on the circuit board which
RISC OS expects to find to hold its essential configuration options needed
before the main !Boot application is run.

It is possible to seed the CMOS settings in one of three ways

  * Use the RTC and CMOS carrier board
    Computers based on the Wandboard Quad supplied by RComp will have
    this fitted by default.
  * Add a CMOS file to the SD card
    Make any configuration settings changes desired then use the *SaveCMOS
    command to capture them in a file, raw write this file on the SD card 
    at disc address &20001200 (that is, offset &1200 on drive SDFS::1).
    The SDCMOS module included in the operating system will update the
    sector whenever a configuration change is made.
  * Do nothing
    If the hardware is not present, and you haven't put a CMOS file on the
    SD card, you'll get the built in defaults every time you turn on.
