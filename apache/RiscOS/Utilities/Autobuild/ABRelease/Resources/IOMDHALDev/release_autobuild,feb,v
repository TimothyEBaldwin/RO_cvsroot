@Support softloading on pre-EDID ROMs
Detail:
  Repoint PreDesk$Configure if no EDID support is available. This ensures that any settings made with the Screen Setup plugin will remain compatible with the host OS.
Admin:
  PreDesk !Run file tested, however the changes to the release_autobuild scripts aren't.

1.2
log
@A few changes to make deciphering what's what easier.
For ROMs we essentially have IOMDHAL[Dev]; Tungsten[Dev]; OMAP3[Dev]; OMAP4Dev and for these it only makes sense to autobuild the Dev ones and offer them as softloads where there's an actual ROM chip to softload over. OMAP4Dev remains development status, IOMDHAL doesn't exist in stable form.
So:
 * IOMDHALDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * IOMDHAL - do not use at this time
 * OMAP3Dev - updated text docs to reflect CMOS use
 * OMAP3 - do not use at this time
 * TungstenDev - only make a softload ZIP file
 * Tungsten - do not use at this time
 * OMAP4Dev - untouched
Removed references to !SCSIForm from InstallHD4 script.
Don't turn off alignment exceptions by default in InstallHD4 script.
Update RMEnsures to 5.19 for development.
Make readme's be non specific about the version to save updating them again.

log
@Made various changes to this component to bring into line with releases.

Various targets from this component now build stuff which fully matches
the things that get uploaded onto the ROOL web site. This removes quite
a bit of manual faffing from the autobuild-then-release process. Next
step will be to fully automate the autobuilder using the modified RPCemu
from Jeffrey Lee.
