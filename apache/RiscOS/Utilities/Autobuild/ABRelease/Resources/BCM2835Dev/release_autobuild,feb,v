@Update Raspberry Pi ROM image name
Detail:
  Resources/BCM2835(Dev)/release_autobuild,feb - For the release candidate images, we've standardised on calling the ROM riscos/img. But the archives produced by the autobuilder output them under the name 'riscos'. Update the autobuilder to also use riscos/img, to save the user the hassle of renaming the image when installing it.

  Untested
