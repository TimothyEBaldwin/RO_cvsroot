1.1
log
@Made various changes to this component to bring into line with releases.

Various targets from this component now build stuff which fully matches
the things that get uploaded onto the ROOL web site. This removes quite
a bit of manual faffing from the autobuild-then-release process. Next
step will be to fully automate the autobuilder using the modified RPCemu
from Jeffrey Lee.
