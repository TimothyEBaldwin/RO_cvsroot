1.3
log
@Made various changes to this component to bring into line with releases.

Various targets from this component now build stuff which fully matches
the things that get uploaded onto the ROOL web site. This removes quite
a bit of manual faffing from the autobuild-then-release process. Next
step will be to fully automate the autobuilder using the modified RPCemu
from Jeffrey Lee.

log
@Fixed some very odd issues in the TungstenDev build.

I don't fully understand what was going wrong, but looked like an odd
interaction with Task Windows, SparkFS and Sunfish. I've removed all
requirement for SparkFS in favour of using the InfoZip CLI tool.

Admin:
  Tested in simple test builds and TungstenDev (but not a full autobuild
  because it's not in cvs yet!)
  Will require Library 1.36 or later.
