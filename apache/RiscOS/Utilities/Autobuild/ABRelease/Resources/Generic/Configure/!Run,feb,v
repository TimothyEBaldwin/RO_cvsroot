Detail:
  Repoint PreDesk$Configure if no EDID support is available. This ensures that any settings made with the Screen Setup plugin will remain compatible with the host OS.
Admin:
  PreDesk !Run file tested, however the changes to the release_autobuild scripts aren't.

Version 0.79. Tagged as 'ABRelease-0_79'
