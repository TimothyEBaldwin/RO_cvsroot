@RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This archive contains the unprocessed resources for the stable release
of the _BUILD_ version of RISC OS.

They are provided to assist translators in preparing internationalised sets of
resources (which are loaded by the !Territory application) for users in
territories where the default United Kingdom resources are inappropriate.

-- RISC OS Open

log
@For stable releases have the autobuilder archive the resources too
On an even numbered release capture the untokenised contents of ResourceFS so that people can translate them for use with !Territory.
Tested with IOMDHAL then cloned to the other ROM outputs, no doubt with plenty of scope for copy and paste mistakes.
