@RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is the S3C2440/S3C6410 development ROM image. It is a bleeding-edge
build which comes from the latest revisions of all the relevant sources in
our source code repository and is completely untested.

Using this ROM image in your machine should only be done if you are confident
that you know what you are doing! It is likely to be functionally incomplete
and probably unstable in various ways.
