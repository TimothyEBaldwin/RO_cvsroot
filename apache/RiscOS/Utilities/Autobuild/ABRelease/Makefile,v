@Made various changes to this component to bring into line with releases.

Various targets from this component now build stuff which fully matches
the things that get uploaded onto the ROOL web site. This removes quite
a bit of manual faffing from the autobuild-then-release process. Next
step will be to fully automate the autobuilder using the modified RPCemu
from Jeffrey Lee.

@Modified path variable for finding local resources.

The entries on the path variable are now fully canonicalised paths in their
own right, rather than relative to the CSD - this is because creating zip
archives requires changing directory into the root of the stuff to archive
which means other resources could no longer be located on the path.

The other reason for changing this was on the off-chance it'd help with the
very odd stiffs happening in autobuilds. But the finger of blame looks more
like it is pointing at Sunfish now.

@Fixed some very odd issues in the TungstenDev build.

I don't fully understand what was going wrong, but looked like an odd
interaction with Task Windows, SparkFS and Sunfish. I've removed all
requirement for SparkFS in favour of using the InfoZip CLI tool.

Admin:
  Tested in simple test builds and TungstenDev (but not a full autobuild
  because it's not in cvs yet!)
  Will require Library 1.36 or later.
