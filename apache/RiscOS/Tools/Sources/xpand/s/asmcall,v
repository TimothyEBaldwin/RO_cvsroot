;
; This makes it possible to call code which scribbles on all the
; registers with a standard ARM procedure call, e.g. from C.
;
; If the code called also scribbles on lk, you must regain control
; by forcing it to branch to asmcall_exit.
;
; NB it relies on scribbling on memory addressed pc-relative, so it
; won't work if the code area is not writable.
