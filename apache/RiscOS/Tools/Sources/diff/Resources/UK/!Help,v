1.2
log
@New command line switch verbose ("-v").When off it only bothers telling
you about files which have actually changed and not silly things like
it changing directory and identical files.The front end has it on by
default to match the old behaviour.
New feature,it has a small table of binary filetypes it knows about - these
are all the binary filetypes the default AcornC/C++ tools can produce.
When one is encountered diff temporarily switches to 'fast' mode and
warns that it's diffing binary files.
