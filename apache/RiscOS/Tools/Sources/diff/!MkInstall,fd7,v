1.3
log
@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.
Detail:
  * Added shell-script make wrapper
  * Uses shared makefile fragments and one master makefile for all variants
  * Started to add ability to execute on other platforms, but more work is
    required on CLXLite to facilitate that
Admin:
  No functional change, so version not incremented
