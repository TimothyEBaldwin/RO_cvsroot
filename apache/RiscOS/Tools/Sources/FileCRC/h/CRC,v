1.2
log
@  Added a C implementation of the assembler CRC function.
Detail:
  RISC OS builds still use the assembler version.  Portable versions will
    have to use the C implementation.
  Some portability changes made, but mostly this program  is not yet
    portable.
Admin:
  Built.

Version 2.26. Tagged as 'FileCRC-2_26'
