log
@  Added a C implementation of the assembler CRC function.
Detail:
  RISC OS builds still use the assembler version.  Portable versions will
    have to use the C implementation.
  Some portability changes made, but mostly this program  is not yet
    portable.
Admin:
  Built.

1.5
log
@  Replaced VersionNum test file with VersionNm in Tests.NCMAlite1 as it
  was  preventing srcommit from tagging this component.

Detail:
  When SrcCommit finds a VersionNum file it checks that the version number
  in the tag matches that in the VersionNum file. If it doesn't
  then it abandons the tagging process.

  The VersionNum file was simply a test file and could be called anything.

Admin:
  Note that the test suite fails because the date/time stamps
  do not match those in the CRC file (they are out by a few seconds).

1.4
log
@  1. Changed error message to make it clearer.
  2. Fixed bug which could conceivably have caused a data abort.

Detail:
  1. A FileCRC check was failing with the error

       File 'DR.foo' inconsistent with 'foo'
       CRC Check Failed

     This implied that there was a problem with the CRC, when in fact
     FleCRC was merely complaining that the pathname was different.
     The error message has been changed so it now reads:

       Filename (or path) 'DR.foo' is inconsistent with 'foo'
       CRC Check Failed

  2. Two strings (*p and *q) were being compared by incrementing both
     p and q until *p!=*q, but there was no check for a \0 terminator,
     so if the data that followed each terminator was the same, then it
     would keep going. This occurred in two separate places.

Admin:
  Tested.

1.3
log
@	Bug fixes and removal of BAR-code.
Detail:
	FileCRC was reporting errors on the size of directories when a build
was dearchived on a different version of filecore to the one that it was
archived on. FileCRC now ignores the size of directories when determining
errors.
	Tidied up some of the code considerably - should run a fair bit
faster. More work to be done, however. Fixed an abysmal piece of BAR-code
that could cause data aborts in extreme circumstances.
Admin:
	Tested on a dearchived build.

log
@	Various little changes.
Detail:
	Now under srccommit control; it obtains its version number from the VersionNum file.
	Errors (CRC, timestamp, exec addresses and filesize) display in a
better manner so that they are actually displayed in English and not
BAR-code.
	StripDepnd support added in the makefile.
Admin:
	Tested on a RiscPC.
