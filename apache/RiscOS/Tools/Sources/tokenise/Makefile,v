@Initial import of sources for tokenise.
These have been written by reverse-engineering a disassembly of the 1988
binary, since we have no idea where the original sources are. A couple of
minor fixes had to be made to readtokens(), because they were causing heap
corruption; evidently this didn't matter with the ancient statically-linked
C library the binary was linked with, but it does upset modern C libraries.
