@Add initial version of ROM compression tool
Detail:
  Tool to compress & decompress RISC OS 5 ROM images.
  Currently images can be compressed using either the squeeze or zlib algorithms, but more algorithms can easily be added in the future
  When decompressing images the decompression stub that was appended to the image will be executed directly; this may need changing in future if CPU compatability issues arise.
  Can only be used with ROM images that have the 'supports compression' flag set in their OS header
  Currently uses lots of memory when compressing images (especially with zlib) due to everything being done in RAM
Admin:
  Tested with compressing/decompressing OMAP3 & OMAP3Live images
  Note: Won't build until the kernel changes are checked in


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'rompress-0_01'
