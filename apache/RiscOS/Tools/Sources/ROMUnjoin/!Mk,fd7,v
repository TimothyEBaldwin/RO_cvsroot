1.1
log
@	Initial import of utility by Robin Cull.

Detail:
	This utility splits a ROM image into it's constituent modules. Each
module is saved into a seperate file numbered 001, 002 etcetera according to
the module's position in the ROM.
	If there are more than 70 files in the ROM it places the first 70 in
a subdirectory called '1', and then next 70 in another called '2', and so on.

Admin:
	I have added a RISC OS - compatible build structure, and a few other
little alterations such as srccommit support and giving the modules 3-digit
numbers.
	Basic tests performed on Lazarus ROM images.

Version 0.01. Tagged as 'ROMUnjoin-0_01'
