@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.

  * Added shell-script make wrapper
  * Uses shared makefile fragments and one master makefile for all variants
  * #includes use CLX path explicitly
Admin:
   No functional change, so version not incremented

log
@  Module flags words are duplicated into squeezed module.
Detail:
  If present, the module flags word(s) are copied to the squeezed header
    of the module to ensure that the kernel can recognise any special
    requirements (e.g. that the module is 32-bit compatible).
Admin:
  Tested on RISC OS and SPARC Solaris - identical output is produced.

1.1
log
@  Made modsqz portable.
Detail:
  Removed byte-order assumptions.
  Removed memory address location assumptions.
  Updated to use CLX's sexing functions where necessary.
  Fixed usage of dynamic memory which had been free()'d.
Admin:
  Tested by building for SPARC Solaris, x86 Solaris and RISC OS and
    verifying that the output of all three versions was byte identical
    for a test module (IPConfig 0.19), and that RISC OS was capable of
    loading and decompressing the module and that unmodsqz was able
    to resurrect the original unsqueezed module.
  Requires CLX build for target host.
  Requires CLXPATH environment variable to point to installed CLX.
