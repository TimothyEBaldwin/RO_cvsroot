1.1
log
@  Made modsqz portable.
Detail:
  Removed byte-order assumptions.
  Removed memory address location assumptions.
  Updated to use CLX's sexing functions where necessary.
  Fixed usage of dynamic memory which had been free()'d.
Admin:
  Tested by building for SPARC Solaris, x86 Solaris and RISC OS and
    verifying that the output of all three versions was byte identical
    for a test module (IPConfig 0.19), and that RISC OS was capable of
    loading and decompressing the module and that unmodsqz was able
    to resurrect the original unsqueezed module.
  Requires CLX build for target host.
  Requires CLXPATH environment variable to point to installed CLX.
