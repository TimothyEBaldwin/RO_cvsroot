1.1
log
@  Builds find tool instead of just storing resources.
Detail:
  Version from SrcFiler modified to use proper ANSI file handling routines
    instead of hacky rawio routines from old CLX library.
  Modified to use VersionNum file for date/version strings.
Admin:
  Requires CLX 1.12 or later.
  Ran a few simple tests.
