1.2
log
@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.
Detail:
  * Added shell-script make wrapper
  * Uses shared makefile fragments and one master makefile for all variants
  * #includes use CLX path explicitly
  * SWI numbers defined explicitly in s.unsqueeze to avoid dealing with the
    issue of RISC OS paths in GET statements
Admin:
   No functional change, so version not incremented

@Ported squeeze to Solaris. cd ccsolaris ; make links ; make derived
You need CLX and aoftoc compiled for your architecture for it to
work. To do this converted the calls to _kernel functions into calls
to the wf_ functions in CLX.
xpand hasnt been ported since it currently works by running the
unsqueeze code that squeeze inserted into the binary and this
doesn't work too well on non-ARM architectures.
