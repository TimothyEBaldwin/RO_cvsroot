@Separate out the xpand tool
Xpand becomes a tool in its own right, since it only shared a header file with squeeze.

1.3
log
@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.
Detail:
  * Added shell-script make wrapper
  * Uses shared makefile fragments and one master makefile for all variants
  * #includes use CLX path explicitly
  * SWI numbers defined explicitly in s.unsqueeze to avoid dealing with the
    issue of RISC OS paths in GET statements
Admin:
   No functional change, so version not incremented
