1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of a RISC OS version of the UNIX tool chmod.
chmod modifies the access settings on files and directories
according to a spec provided by the caller.
 
Tested on sample directory strutures.
 
Documentation supplied for usage and design.  This version
supports recursive operation (-R) and both octal and symbolic
permission specifications including combinational settings.
