1.2
log
@Fixed install rule.
Changed behaviour when a colon is found in the argument: in this case, it
now passes the directory name through to the OS unchanged. This allows the
creation of directories containing a slash character (eg "AcornC/C++") for
the first time.
Note that in previous versions, any attempt to create a directory using a
UNIX-style pathname that included a colon would have produced undesirable
effects anyway.

Version 1.02. Tagged as 'mkdir-1_02'

Detail:
  The source code to this utility could not be found, so it has been
  recreated by disassembling with SID and edited for 32-bit compatibility,
  to remove dead code and correct a minor bug. The original binary is
  preserved in the 'original' directory for posterity.
Admin:
  Brief testing indicates that it works as before.
