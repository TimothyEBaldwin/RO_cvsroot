log
@  Initial import
Detail:
  The source code to this utility could not be found, so it has been
  recreated by disassembling with SID and edited for 32-bit compatibility,
  to remove dead code and correct a minor bug. The original binary is
  preserved in the 'original' directory for posterity.
Admin:
  Brief testing indicates that it works as before.
