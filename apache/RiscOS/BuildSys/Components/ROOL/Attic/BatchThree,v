@Various changes
* Added components file to generate a !System
* Binaries/Browse/BuildEnv/Disc/IOMD32/OMAP4/Printers/Tungsten add heading blocks and line stuff up
* OMAP3 remove unused switch from FPEmulator
* SysMap add mapping from Sovereign to 'V'
* CTools extra qualifiers on some modules to get help right for modules in the 310 directory
* AAsmModule when CMDHELP=None is in force you can infer that no international help is desired, therefore pass this as a switch to the module to allow it to remove the tokens from its help table (based on how the 'standalone' switch is done)

@Sweeping changes to allow for builds using new directory structure.

The new way to do builds will be to leave source code for almost everything
in place in the relevant subdirectories (e.g. "apache", "bsd", etc) rather
than merge them all into one "Sources" directory. More detail to be put in
the ROOL wiki shortly.

@  Added CTools disc build, and various supporting changes
Detail:
  * Updates to CModule makefile fragment to reduce the number of OS-specific
    rules in main Makefiles:
    + Added (RAM|ROM)(C|ASM)DEFINES variables. These allow the calling makefile
      to specify additional defines for RAM or ROM builds of C or assembler
      source files respectively. Traditionally this was done by having separate
      object files for RAM and ROM corresponding at least to whichever source
      file was responsible for interfacing with ResourceFS, but this requires
      messy additional rules. With this new approach, it is necessary to clean
      the component when switching between RAM and ROM builds, but I don't
      think this will affect many people's workflows.
    + Added CMHGDEPENDS. This should be used to specify which object files need
      a static dependency upon the h file autogenerated from the cmhg file.
      It should be specified in the usual form for object files passed to
      CModule - with neither an o. prefix nor a .o suffix.
  * Added TBOXINTLIB to ModuleLibs makefile fragment.
  * AsmUtils, HdrSrc, TCPIPheaders, ToolboxLib and UnicodeLib all upgraded in
    ModuleDB from EXP to ASM or C components, to permit them to be built in the
    install phase. As a result, those other Components files that didn't
    already do so now need to override this back to -type EXP.
  * BuildHost Components file edited to reflect the fact that binaof, binasm,
    modgen and ResGen now have separate install phases for executables and
    Docs files.
Admin:
  The new Components file uses various components that are not publicly
  released, so it can only sensibly be used internally by ROOL. However, it's
  more convenient for us to keep it alongside the other Components files - and
  it also serves as an illustration of how to do a disc build.
