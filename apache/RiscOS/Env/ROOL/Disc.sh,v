@  Refactor cross-compilation environment scripts
Detail:
  In tentative efforts to support cross-compilation to date, a few
  components have had mk.sh scripts inserted. These are functionally
  equivalent to the !Mk* TaskObey files, in that they are a convenience for
  developers working on that component in isolation. However, unlike their
  RISC OS equivalents, the nature of shell scripts means that they are
  relatively complex, and are therefore relatively burdensome to create and
  maintain. This commit replaces this mechanism with a shell function which
  is defined when you source the Env file. This enables a build phase to be
  applied to the component at the working directory to be built with a
  simple "mk export", "mk install", "mk rom", "mk clean" and so on.
  Previously, the build variables COMPONENT, TARGET and INSTDIR were encoded
  in the mk.sh script, and where a component had multiple targets, the mk.sh
  script would run the phase on all such components; now the mk function
  scans the ModuleDB to locate this information instead. You can even target
  a component in another directory using the -C switch (chosen to match
  make's equivalent switch). Some efforts have also been made to support
  Posix shells other than bash. The only feature dropped is the ability to
  build the component using a different environment within a subshell.
  However it's relatively simple to construct this at the command line if
  desired.
