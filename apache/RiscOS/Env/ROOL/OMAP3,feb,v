@Add new HALSize variable to env files
Detail:
  HALSize is a new environment variable supported by the OMAP3 HAL & Cortex kernel. As you'd expect, it's used to indicate the size of the HAL.
  The variable is actually used to select from one of several HALSize files in HdrSrc, much like the ImageSize variable.
  The OMAP3 env file is set to use a 96K HAL, the other builds are set to 64K.
  Apart from changing the HALSize setting, currently you also have to remember to change the Kernel offset in the corresponding components file.
Admin:
  Needed for my next batch of checkins to work.

log
@  Change to Machine build variable for OMAP builds
Detail:
  Now uses CortexA8 machine type. This enables the kernel to be build with
  the correct memory management support (which is different from that for
  earlier 32-bit machines, which continue to use Machine="32").
Admin:
  Untested. Requires HdrSrc-1_62-4_162_2_5
