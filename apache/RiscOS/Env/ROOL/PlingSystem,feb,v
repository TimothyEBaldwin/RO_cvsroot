@Change PlingSystem over to using the new "26" machine type
Detail:
  ROOL/PlingSystem,feb - Instead of using the Archimedes machine type, use "26". This allows for e.g. recognition of the StrongARM MSR bug in Hdr:Machine.Machine, and allows CLib to build multiple variants of some routines to target the different CPU architectures (e.g. long multiplies)
Admin:
  Tested with PlingSystem build
  Requires HdrSrc-2_63, Library-1_87, BuildSys-6_90
