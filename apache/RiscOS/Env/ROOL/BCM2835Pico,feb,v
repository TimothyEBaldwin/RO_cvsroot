@  Add Raspberry Pi 2 support
Detail:
  The Raspberry Pi ROM now joins the IOMD ROM in supporting multiple
  architectures, in this case ARMv6 and ARMv7. This has been achieved by
  creating a new machine type specific for Raspberry Pi. The old ARM11ZF
  machine type remains for builds that are ARM11-only.

Version 1.31. Tagged as 'Env-1_31'
