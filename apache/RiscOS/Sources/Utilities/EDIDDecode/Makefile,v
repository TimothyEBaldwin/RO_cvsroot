@Add EDIDDecode tool to source control
Detail:
  Perhaps better known as "Decode EDID", EDIDDecode is a tool originally written by Will Ling at Castle, for converting raw EDID dumps to RISC OS mode files
  According to Will it's based on the VESA Excel spreadsheet for the GTF calculations, and as much information as was available on the Internet at the time (a lot less than what's available now).
  Apart from the addition of the Castle licence text and a fresh makefile, this is the original code as received from Will
Admin:
  Builds, but untested


Version 1.21. Tagged as 'EDIDDecode-1_21'
