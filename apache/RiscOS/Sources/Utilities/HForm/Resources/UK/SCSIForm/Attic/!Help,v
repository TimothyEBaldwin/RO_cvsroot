@Reunify SCSIForm with its older sister HForm.
Hopefully reduces confusion since the differences between them is so small, and eeks a few more months of life out of the utility.
Fixed some incorrect memory clears counting words, using !, but count in 1s.
Fixed some missing internationalisation in SCSIForm
Merged messages files.
Logic is now that if only one of ADFS or SCSIFS is present on startup that will be selected by default, if both a present then the user is prompted for which to look at the default being SCSIFS.
Version number comes from messages file, and is used in the graphical banner on startup.

Version 2.60. Tagged as 'HForm-2_60'

                   =========

The !SCSIForm application is used to format new SCSI 
discs for use with RISC OS.  Read the appendix in 
the RISC OS User Guide before using this
program - it obliterates all the information on the
hard disc.

@	update of HForm to build !SCSIForm to format SCSI media in
	USB Mass storage to filecore format
Detail:
        Builds either HForm or SCSIForm form relevant !Mk files.
	Also added code to ensure that when formatting filecore format
	any DOS format info is removed, and an appropriate boot sector
	installed to permit reformatting with DOS format by DOS machines.
	(this stops ambiguous usage)
Admin:
	Not exhaustively tested..
	HForm builds.. will need doublechecking before any release is made
	from this version.
	SCSIForm has been reasonably well tested.. will be released initially
	on the beta test site for further scrutiny.
	Castle added IP


Version 2.55. Not tagged
