@Be somewhat more frugal with WimpSlot and change clamp point
Over time, as HForm has been asked to format drives with more and more cyinders/heads the WimpSlot has grown too, up to 10MB from HForm-2_61. However the majority of that memory is only needed when performing the verify step as the test pattern is built in RAM in a buffer of size cylinders*sectors, at all other times the RAM requirements are much less (just enough for bits of map). Rather than a fixed WimpSlot grab in the !Run file, only the memory needed is obtained at run time using BASIC's END= construct.

In HForm-2_69 a clamp was introduced for big SCSI media, however the clamp was set incorrectly, since log2(502GB) is 30 which means the disc address would spill out of the idlen bits into bit 0 of the drive number when represented as a 32 bit disc address. Additionally, the use of BASIC's signed integers would mean any disc bigger than 1TB (2^31 sectors) wouldn't have the clamp applied.

bas/!RunImage:
 Only grab the RAM required if the soak test is enabled
 Correct the clamp (both its magnitude and signedness) to 2^29 as used 25 lines further up for IDE discs
Resources/UK/!Help:
 Reinforce that option (M) for SDFS is the memory card option.
Resources/UK/Messages
 Have 3 dots in the elipsis to match what command line verify with FileCore does.
Resources/UK/!Run:
 Reduce the WimpSlot back to 2MB, and relax the RMEnsure on UtilityModule since the fixes in HForm-2_61 mean it works on RISC OS 3.10 anyway.

Tested on a 4MB A5000 formatting a maximally sized (for its era) 512MB drive.

@                     !HForm 
                     ======

The !HForm application is used to prepare blank media for use
with RISC OS in its native FileCore format for use with ADFS,
SCSIFS, or memory cards via SDFS.

Read the appendix in the RISC OS User Guide before using this
program - it obliterates all the information on the
hard disc.

@Build clean up
* Remove local copy of 'Number' util
* Remove unused SCSIForm exec file
* Update !Help to refer to SDFS
* Makefile changed to be based around the CApp fragment

@Reunify SCSIForm with its older sister HForm.
Hopefully reduces confusion since the differences between them is so small, and eeks a few more months of life out of the utility.
Fixed some incorrect memory clears counting words, using !, but count in 1s.
Fixed some missing internationalisation in SCSIForm
Merged messages files.
Logic is now that if only one of ADFS or SCSIFS is present on startup that will be selected by default, if both a present then the user is prompted for which to look at the default being SCSIFS.
Version number comes from messages file, and is used in the graphical banner on startup.

@Fix broken HForm, fix version numbers, rewrite makefile to avoid HForm/SCSIForm mixups
Detail:
  bas/!RunImage, Makefile - Removed an errant space that was breaking HForm. Changed #defines from HForm/SCSIForm to IsHForm/IsSCSIForm to prevent system variables and other text being replaced by the preprocessor.
  Makefile, crunch/!RI_HForm,ffe, crunch/!RI_SCSIForm,ffe, crunch/!RunImage,ffe - Rewrote makefile so that the intermediate runimage files get built to seperate locations for HForm & SCSIForm. This is a workaround for the wrong runimage being used if the 'install disc' phase is re-run after performing a disc build.
  bas/!RunImage, Makefile, Resources/UK/HForm/Messages, Resources/UK/SCSIForm/Messages - Version numbers are now provided by the AwkVers script instead of being hard-coded in the messages files.
  Resources/UK/* - Deleted obsolete resource files from before HForm was able to build SCSIForm
Admin:
  Tested HForm on an Iyonix by formatting a spare drive. SCSIForm runs, but formatting is untested.
  Fixes HForm 'SWI name not known' error reported on forums: http://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/556
