@Fix broken HForm, fix version numbers, rewrite makefile to avoid HForm/SCSIForm mixups
Detail:
  bas/!RunImage, Makefile - Removed an errant space that was breaking HForm. Changed #defines from HForm/SCSIForm to IsHForm/IsSCSIForm to prevent system variables and other text being replaced by the preprocessor.
  Makefile, crunch/!RI_HForm,ffe, crunch/!RI_SCSIForm,ffe, crunch/!RunImage,ffe - Rewrote makefile so that the intermediate runimage files get built to seperate locations for HForm & SCSIForm. This is a workaround for the wrong runimage being used if the 'install disc' phase is re-run after performing a disc build.
  bas/!RunImage, Makefile, Resources/UK/HForm/Messages, Resources/UK/SCSIForm/Messages - Version numbers are now provided by the AwkVers script instead of being hard-coded in the messages files.
  Resources/UK/* - Deleted obsolete resource files from before HForm was able to build SCSIForm
Admin:
  Tested HForm on an Iyonix by formatting a spare drive. SCSIForm runs, but formatting is untested.
  Fixes HForm 'SWI name not known' error reported on forums: http://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/556
