@About draw tags

Draw tag blocks are allocated for applications which implement tagged draw
objects in accordance with the DrawFile functional specification (found in
Volume 4 of the RISC OS 3 Programmers Reference Manual).  They are allocated
in blocks of &100.  A block is allocated to a company, not to an individual 
product.  A new allocation can be requested once a current one  has been
exhausted.

If a draw tag block is required then you will need to ensure that the 'block
required' option is turned on and a description of what it will be used for
is entered.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.@

@Import of Allocate sources
Lost since 2003-ish, these correspond to version 1.10 at the point of handover from Pineapple.
Since the application was originally written by James Bye of Acorn customer services and a number of the sources have Acorn headers, they've been placed under the Castle licence.
