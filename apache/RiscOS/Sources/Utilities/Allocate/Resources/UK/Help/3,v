@About Filetypes

Filetypes are allocated to third parties who have developed an application
which implements its own file format, where users can save the data out in
this form and double click on the file to run/load the data into the
application.  Filetypes are usually allocated on a one-per-product basis.  If
you feel that your application needs more than one filetype (because it can
save, say, two different internal data formats) then you should look at the
file format design and try and integrate the two.  You should design your
file format with headers and objects (see the format of DrawFiles for a good
example).

If a filetype is required then you will need to enter the name of the
application that the filetype is for and the desired name for the filetype
(Maximum of 8 characters).  If your filetype can be double clicked and then
load/run the application and the data, then you  should turn on the option
button for 'Double clicking Supported' (it is  worth noting that filetypes
that do not support Double clicking protocols  are not usually allocated). 
You will also be required to drag the sprites to represent the file, a
description of the product and its internal file format before an allocation
can take place.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.

@Import of Allocate sources
Lost since 2003-ish, these correspond to version 1.10 at the point of handover from Pineapple.
Since the application was originally written by James Bye of Acorn customer services and a number of the sources have Acorn headers, they've been placed under the Castle licence.
