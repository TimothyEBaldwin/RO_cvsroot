@About draw objects

Draw object blocks are allocated for applications which implement their own
objects in draw files.  They are allocated in blocks of &40.  A block is
allocated to a company, not to an individual product.  A new allocation can
be requested once a current one has been exhausted.

If a draw object block is required then you will need to ensure that the
'block required' option is turned on and a description of what it will be
used for is entered.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.@

@Import of Allocate sources
Lost since 2003-ish, these correspond to version 1.10 at the point of handover from Pineapple.
Since the application was originally written by James Bye of Acorn customer services and a number of the sources have Acorn headers, they've been placed under the Castle licence.
