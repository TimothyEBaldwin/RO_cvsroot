@Consistency updates
Get the version from _Version, put the original author back to Acorn (Pace couldn't possibly have written it in 1994, this looks like some idealistic rebranding while ROL were maintainers).
Make the sections in the !Help self consistent and consistent with the app they describe.
Make sure !Run checks for the right C library for a disc component.
Enlarged the display fields in the info box per Style Guide.
