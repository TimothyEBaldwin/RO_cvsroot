@About !Allocate
---------------

The !Allocate application is a general purpose application for submitting
allocation request to Acorn.  In the past there have been three applications
that cover the following :-

        !Request -    filetype request
        !Reserve -    name reservations
        !Alloc   -    general allocations (SWI Chunks, Error blocks etc...)
        
!Allocate combines all the above types of allocations into one application. 

Please read !Allocate.!Help for more information on using !Allocate.

@Import of Allocate sources
Lost since 2003-ish, these correspond to version 1.10 at the point of handover from Pineapple.
Since the application was originally written by James Bye of Acorn customer services and a number of the sources have Acorn headers, they've been placed under the Castle licence.
