@Aquarius/objasm updates
Add AREA directive and change ENTRY to Entry for objasm.
Implement the Service_WindowDeleted (from ColourPicker, for Aquarius) handling.
Builds to a binary identical module as 0.05, with the exception of objasm not adding post-increment of 0 to LDR/STR, and the Push/Pull macros avoiding LDM/STM for single register situations.

Version 0.05. Tagged as 'BorderUtils-0_05'
