@Import of Ursula and Morris4 themed sprites
Addtionally
* Recovered the PocketFS & Advance patches, there's no reason to hide them, especially as they're mentioned in !Help
* Unsqueeze module made 26/32 bit neutral since this is on the disc image
* RMEnsure in !Run bumped up to make sure the above change is taken
* 2D templates shelved
* Auto insert version number into info box
* Made some Ursula contemporary sprites

Version number bumped (now it's actually displayed) by 1.32 + 0.04 to correspond to Acorn's last version plus 4 commits here.
Tested with a fake !PocketFS application, applying then removing the patch.

Version 1.36. Tagged as 'Patch-1_36'
