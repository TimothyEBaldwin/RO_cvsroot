log
@  This code has hacked me off for the last time.
Detail:
  As much as possible of the junk has been removed.
  Standard build structure replaces it.
  Unused code removed.
  Support for RISC OS pre-3.60 removed (remove the int'l
    stuff in the CMHG file to reverse this - it must save
    all of 100 bytes!)
  RAM builds now contain the resources for registering in
    ResourceFS (NOTE: this build does not register them yet
    but that's the same as current versions!)  When this is
    fixed, the RAM builds will be the standalone builds.
  RAM build contains a single ResourceFS area which is to be
    registered instead of NINE that it used to register.
  Shame I can't remove all traces of the other directories.
  WinEdit is now invoked from the makefile instead of having
    several silly one-liner Obey scripts to do it.  However, this
    necessitates the perl script to fix the trigraphs (cannot
    use # in makefiles) unless you like 1000s of warnings about
    ANSI trigraphs in the (valid) generated headers.
  Unable to extract it from OSLib or Support011 - it's too
     heavily dependent on them.  Sorry.
Admin:
  RAM builds seem to work.

log
@No longer trashes the task's flags to Wimp_Poll. It used to ANT the
flags with a word that only preserved specific bits; notably, it would
clear the pollword high priority (23) and preserve/save FP (24) bits.
The latter means the FPSR gets reset, which is a bit of a pain if you
are relying on it being preserved (e.g. any task using the Mozilla
sourced JS interpreter...!).

Tested on RISC OS 3.71 and 3.11. Version number incremented to 0.40
for the Risc PC build (assumes resources are present in ResourceFS) and
0.37 for the stand-alone build (makes no such assumptions).
