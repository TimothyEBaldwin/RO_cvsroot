1.2
log
@  RAM builds are now standalone builds.
  CPFLAGS added to header export.
Detail:
  STANDALONE builds no longer exist - they are equivalent to
    non-ROM builds.
  In non-ROM builds, all the resources to be registered in
    ResourceFS are built into a single structure since ResourceFS
    can handle this more efficiently, and it saves initialisation
    time - MessageTrans has a fit when Picker tries to register
    NINE different things in ResourceFS.
Admin:
  Tested as softload.
  ROM build unaffected.

Version 0.44. Tagged as 'Picker-0_44'
