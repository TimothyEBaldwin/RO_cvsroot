4.1
log
@  This code has hacked me off for the last time.
Detail:
  As much as possible of the junk has been removed.
  Standard build structure replaces it.
  Unused code removed.
  Support for RISC OS pre-3.60 removed (remove the int'l
    stuff in the CMHG file to reverse this - it must save
    all of 100 bytes!)
  RAM builds now contain the resources for registering in
    ResourceFS (NOTE: this build does not register them yet
    but that's the same as current versions!)  When this is
    fixed, the RAM builds will be the standalone builds.
  RAM build contains a single ResourceFS area which is to be
    registered instead of NINE that it used to register.
  Shame I can't remove all traces of the other directories.
  WinEdit is now invoked from the makefile instead of having
    several silly one-liner Obey scripts to do it.  However, this
    necessitates the perl script to fix the trigraphs (cannot
    use # in makefiles) unless you like 1000s of warnings about
    ANSI trigraphs in the (valid) generated headers.
  Unable to extract it from OSLib or Support011 - it's too
     heavily dependent on them.  Sorry.
Admin:
  RAM builds seem to work.
