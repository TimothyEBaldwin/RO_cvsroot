@  Updated to build using shared makefiles
Detail:
  * Makefile rewritten
  * Language-dependent resource files moved into Resources.UK
  * Four header files (in "icons" subdirectory) that are autogenerated by
    running WinEd are now committed to CVS, to aid with cross-compilation.
    These icon number definitions haven't changed in over 21 years, and
    if they were to do so, it would be a one-off job to run WinEd on a
    RISC OS machine to regenerate them: the original rules have been retained
    for this purpose. Since the only other component that uses WinEd like
    this is ResEd, it seems unlikely that it will ever be worth the effort to
    create a cross-compiling version of WinEd!
