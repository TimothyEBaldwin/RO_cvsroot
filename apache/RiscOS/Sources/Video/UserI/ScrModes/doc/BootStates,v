@Offer export of raw EDID blob and complementary MDF export
Detail:
  Export the EDID raw data as a file in ResourceFS. This allows the Screen Setup plugin to scan that directory to pick up the currently connected monitor, and similarly select it from !Boot.Choices.PreDesk. The EDID data can also be drag & drop copied or exported for offline analysis.
  Add SaveModeFile command. This differs in that it works on the current set, to be symmetrical with LoadModeFile which loads the current set. Also fixes issues of losing the original mode names given; NULL pointer dereference when the EDID block contains no modes (eg. VIDCDriver); and no long writes out malformed MDFs which can't be loaded into !MakeModes (this seems to be because the CreateModeFile command was based on a stale copy of EDIDDecode which fixed the same bug circa 2012).
  Query the current GraphicsV driver for the deepest colour depth for the preferred mode, rather than assuming 32bpp is always possible (eg. because of bandwidth or graphics controller constraints).
  If the configured MonitorType is EDID but no EDID could be read, or it was corrupt, substitute a safe VESA monitor to allow the kernel to select something close to MODE 28.
  Add ScreenModes_Features SWI so the Screen Setup plugin knows whether it's safe to offer EDID in its dialogues.
  Retire the ReadEDID command (no longer needed since LoadModeFile can load the exported EDID blob, or one from disc) and CreateModeFile commands (see SaveModeFile).
  Internationalise the default monitor title ("Unidentified") used when EDID doesn't contain one.
Admin:
  New file - doc/BootStates documents all possible situations, and their recovery, for both the MDF and (non-hotplug) EDID schemes.
  New file - doc/EDIDGoals states the aims of the EDID support from both a user and support perspective.

  Submission for the EDID bounty.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS: Doesn't support EDID, configured with MonitorType Auto

Monitor is?      Plugged in?  Outcome?                                                  Recovery story?

Different model  Yes          Only a good image if earlier MDF works on new monitor     Blind type *WimpMode, then run !Configure to choose new model
than before      No           No image                                                  -

Notes
~~~~~
Monitors are required to return EDID data if connected in, even if not turned on - the EDID memory is powered by
the motherboard. Therefore, the above tables only consider the connected/not connected possibilities since the
monitor being off or on isn't important.

Tables assume hotplug is not supported by the hardware, let alone the software, and that EDID data from the
monitor is truthful. Hotplug support in a later version will remove all requirements to recover a bad mode choice
by blind typing when the monitor is plugged in after booting, presently a reboot is required.
