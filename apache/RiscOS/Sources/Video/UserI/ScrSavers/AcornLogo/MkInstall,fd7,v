@Numerous screensaver/setup improvements
Notably the setup application allowed the setting of the aniation speed but that didn't affect the animation speed at all. This was because the corresponding code in the screensaver was disabled due to being totally wrong.
Now, the speed setting is interpreted, and for the double banked case the previous frame is blacked out and for the single bank case the area moved is blacked out (to eliminate flicker).
Squash the animation frames so they don't occupy 765k of disc space, new unsquash code added (from Pogo saver).
Set 'Cancel' as the escape action button so the setup window closes when Escape is pressed.
Other admin changes:
* Makefiles recreated from fragments
* Version number now auto inserted from VersionNum
* Messages and common code "saver.c" sync'd with other screensaver/setup apps
* Removed references to Filer Configure from RMEnsure error messages
* Removed never used info from setup app messages, ensuring they're never out of date by deleting them
* Removed non internationalised "Screensave setup" from error box titles
* Load settings from Choices: write settings through <Choices$Write>
* Fix null pointer dereference when -openat switch has too few arguments
* Symbolic names used instead of magic numbers where possible
Tested on RISC OS 4.02.
