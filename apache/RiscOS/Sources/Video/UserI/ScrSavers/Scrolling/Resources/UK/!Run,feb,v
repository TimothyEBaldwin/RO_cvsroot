@Numerous screensaver/setup improvements
Simplified reading/writing of choices, and error handling therein.
Set 'Cancel' as the escape action button so the setup window closes when Escape is pressed.
Other admin changes:
* Makefiles recreated from fragments
* Version number now auto inserted from VersionNum
* Messages and common code "saver.c" sync'd with other screensaver/setup apps
* Removed never used info from setup app messages, ensuring they're never out of date by deleting them
* Removed non internationalised "Screensave setup" from error box titles
* Load settings from Choices: write settings through <Choices$Write>
* Fix null pointer dereference when -openat switch has too few arguments
* Symbolic names used instead of magic numbers where possible
Tested on RISC OS 4.02.

@This screensaver was somewhat unfinished and would blow up with a
postmortem at various points,as would its settings program.
Tidied settings dialogue.
Made the colour picker work.
Got rid of the unused variables/warnings.
Made its representation of colour numbers consisten (chosen_colour).
Settings filetype is now text.
Fantastic - it works now.
