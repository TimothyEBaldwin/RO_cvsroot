@Numerous screensaver/setup improvements
Simplified reading/writing of choices, and error handling therein.
Set 'Cancel' as the escape action button so the setup window closes when Escape is pressed.
Other admin changes:
* Makefiles recreated from fragments
* Version number now auto inserted from VersionNum
* Messages and common code "saver.c" sync'd with other screensaver/setup apps
* Removed never used info from setup app messages, ensuring they're never out of date by deleting them
* Removed non internationalised "Screensave setup" from error box titles
* Load settings from Choices: write settings through <Choices$Write>
* Fix null pointer dereference when -openat switch has too few arguments
* Symbolic names used instead of magic numbers where possible
Tested on RISC OS 4.02.

@Fix to not fail to open the settings plugin.
In version 0.06 some RMEnsures were added but these refer to non
existant versions of the toolbox modules, hence giving "ColourDBox has
active clients" type errors. RMEnsures changed to those that were
pertinent around 1998 when this plugin was written.
Version number in messages file hand cranked.
Fixed to read choices from Choices: not Choices$Write.
Error boxes no longer hve "PhotoQV" in their title bar.
Tested briefly, config file is written to the right place, and read back
successfully.

@Fixed the !Run file to RMEnsure modules that it required.
Note: this program data aborts when you click "OK" and writes a junk config
file that breaks the screensaver! That will need looking into...! :(
