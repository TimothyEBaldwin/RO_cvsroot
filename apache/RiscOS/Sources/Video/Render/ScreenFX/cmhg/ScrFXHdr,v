@  Various bug fixes; new 'escape' feature.
Detail:
  Incorrect command line help text fixed. Failure to pass duration to
  effects engine for crossfades corrected. New bit to Fade and CrossFade
  SWIs with corresponding "-escape" switch on the command line; allows
  Escape key to interrupt fades. Documentation updated. Internal effects
  initialisation and finalisation tidied up a bit. Now uses header files
  in Global for EventV and PaletteV definitions (note, BBE will require
  the addition of Global/h/PaletteV in the Export tree).
Testing:
  Moderate developer testing on Iyonix platform. Test harness unchanged.

1.2
log
@  Bug fixes, redundant code removed, new feature.
Detail:
  Rounding errors fixed, so test harness now completes - fades always do
  completely achieve the target parameters. Interruption timing: When a
  new fade interrupts an old one, the percentage of its duration that is
  used depends on how long the fade had been going, not how long it had
  left to go. See Docs.API for why. Now links with PRISMLib the module
  version - stops various odd effects (the bits of shared Makefile in use
  do *not* automatically add a "zm" suffix, so the old version didn't
  work so well). New feature: *ScreenFXReset, or SWI ScreenFX_Reset - as
  ScreenFX_Cancel, plus a reset to default gamma and supremacy tables.
  Again, see Docs.API for details. Finally, the Service_MessagesFileClosed
  handler has been removed - the module does not *maintain* pointers into
  the messages file, since it looks up tokens anew each time they are
  needed, so therefore it does not need to handle the service call.
Admin:
  Interrupted fade timing looks better. No more odd effects when switching
  between debug and non-debug modules. Test harness passes its check that
  the tables are programmed as expected at the end of a fade. Reset feature
  works as it should.
