@  Various bug fixes; new 'escape' feature.
Detail:
  Incorrect command line help text fixed. Failure to pass duration to
  effects engine for crossfades corrected. New bit to Fade and CrossFade
  SWIs with corresponding "-escape" switch on the command line; allows
  Escape key to interrupt fades. Documentation updated. Internal effects
  initialisation and finalisation tidied up a bit. Now uses header files
  in Global for EventV and PaletteV definitions (note, BBE will require
  the addition of Global/h/PaletteV in the Export tree).
Testing:
  Moderate developer testing on Iyonix platform. Test harness unchanged.
