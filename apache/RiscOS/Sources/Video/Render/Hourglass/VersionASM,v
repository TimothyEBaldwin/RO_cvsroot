@Make 0 easier to distinguish from 8
Unlike the written word where '0' and 'O' might be confused, a percentage can't contain a 'O'. However as the character set is only 8 pixels wide it is easy to misread '0' and '8'.
Altered the character definition to not have a slash.

@  Bugfix for pointer colour restoration.
Detail:
  In Ursula, functionality was added such that if anyone else changes the
  pointer colours (except via SWI Hourglass_Colours) then the Hourglass module
  remembered the change, and re-applied it when the hourglass was turned off.
  The problem was that it determines that the colours have been changed by
  reading the colours in use at each animation stage, and comparing them with
  those that it programmed most recently. We got away with this in the final
  Ursula version (and in a branched version, derived thereof) because the
  hourglass used unusual colours; however, we've picked up an intermediate
  version that still has a RISC OS 3 style hourglass, with pointer colour 1
  being full intensity cyan - /the same as the default Wimp pointer colour 1/.
  This means that the hourglass ignored the Wimp's initial programming of
  pointer colour 1, and restored it to black at the end of the boot sequence.
  The solution I have used is to install a routine on PaletteV, and note
  the pointer colours being programmed (either singly or in bulk) directly.
Admin:
  Tested on Tungsten.
