@Rework maketables to not need ColourTrans loaded at build time
During generation of the 32k colour lookup tables, the tool already has to hand the 5:5:5 RGB value and 8:8:8 RGB palette, so can do the colour lookup itself. This removes the need to build a platform agnostic ColourTrans module, it's just C code.
* Replace make_32k_table() with brute force colour matcher
* Use <stdio.h> functions to write out the output, change to use <stdint.h>
* Simplify top level makefile
* Header.s: minor warning squashed
Binary output compared with Colours-1_83.

@  Build fix
Detail:
  The build utility MkTables.maketables, compiled at build time, is now built
  using the HostTools shared makefile, and so will execute on any RISC OS
  build host even if the default compiler options are to target an
  incompatible ARM architecture.
Admin:
  Tested using an APCS-R build on an Iyonix.
