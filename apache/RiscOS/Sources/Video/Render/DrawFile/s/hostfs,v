1.1
log
@  Improvements to soft-loadable builds of the module
Detail:
  Previously had an over-complicated method of accessing data block to install
  in ResourceFS and had needless duplication of Messages files in build. Also
  it was impossible to automate the building of the pre-RISC OS 3.6 variant
  of the module. All fixed by rewriting the makefile to use shared makefile
  fragments (and moving assembler sources to conventional 's' subdirectory).
Admin:
  Tested in Tools CD build.

Version 1.54. Tagged as 'DrawFile-1_54'
