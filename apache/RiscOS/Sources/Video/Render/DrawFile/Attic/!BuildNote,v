log
@Unused files removed from Trunk
@
text
@DrawFile was built with version 0.10 of the Support library.

To allow the objects to be rebuilt as released, the two
Support library files riscos.h and riscos.c have been copied
locally from version 0.10.

Apart from building identical objects, DrawFile can be built
with the latest version of Lib.Support.
