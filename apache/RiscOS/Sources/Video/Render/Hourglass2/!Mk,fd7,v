1.1
log
@  BASIC application generates 32-bit compatible modules.
Detail:
  The HourMake application has been modified to generate 32-bit compatible
    modules.  The generated Hourglass modules still work on 26-bit systems.
  The module now takes the Hourglass2 VersionNum file details to generate
    the module date and version number of the generated hourglass modules.
Admin:
  Tested on Ursula softload.
  The Hourglass modules themselves have NOT been updated.  Thus including
    this version of Hourglass2 in a build will NOT give you a 32-bit
    hourglass module.
  Hourglass2 version number increased from 0.06 to 4.09 to bring it into
    line with the generated modules.

Version 4.09. Tagged as 'Hourglass2-4_09'
