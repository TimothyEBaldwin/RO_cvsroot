1.1
log
@  Updated to bring into line with STB Baseline builds.
Detail:
  * Fixed viafile contents so that the module builds
  * Module (modgen) build now takes version number from the VersionNum file
  * Module target is built into an 'rm' directory
  * Viafile is now located in LocalUserIFRes: so different builds may take different encodings
  * Clean phase added (useful for module builds)
  * Encodings brought into sync with STB builds
  * STB400.UK resources updated to match those in Baseline builds
  * MkClean and MkInstSTB taskobey files added for development
Admin:
  Builds correctly.

Version 0.20. Tagged as 'Unicode-0_20'
