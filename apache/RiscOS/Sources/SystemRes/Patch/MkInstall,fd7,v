@Remove ineffective check for bit 31 of AIF flags word
Application note 295 boldly declared bit 31 of AIF as "application is StrongARM compatible", however the AIF docs nor the tools were ever updated to implement this.
Hence, the quick exit when the flag is set never triggers, and 17 years on it might as well not bother.
Also - added a syntax reminder in *PATCHSTATS rather than a blank line.
Resolves ticket #310.

@Fix to not badly corrupt random bits of RMA
The C compiler switches were missing the -zM switch, and C code was referencing data in far away areas (which don't get reduced to position independent ADRs).
It's hard to see how this would have ever worked, but rather than worry too much about it, just change it so it does.
* Makefile gains -zM switches and general tidying up
* Generate CMHG header file so the C code matches the module header prototypes, and rename the CMHG file so as not to confuse the unix<->RISC OS filename translation
* Be more strict and only match on subreason 1 of Service_UKCompression rather than any non zero subreason
* If the pathname exceeds 255 characters, right justify it and add an elipsis rather than overruning the buffer
* Remove some dubious casts
* Add a bit of assembler to the 'GetSig' macro to do the position independent bit
Tested on StrongARM RISC OS 4.02, with an application known to need patching. Patch count was 1, and machine didn't stiff.
