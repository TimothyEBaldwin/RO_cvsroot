@Move beep on error option into Sound Setup
Part of simplification of the window setup plugin.
Also, to avoid having to maintain two similar plugins, the differences from the former VIDC oriented Sound Setup are integrated
* If SoundControl module is running behave as before
* If no SoundControl but there is a VIDC, adapt to add
  + 16b/8b hardware option
  + oversampling option
  + don't permit muting of the (one and only) mixing channel
  + the mixing channel governs the *VOLUME and corresponding CMOS bits
* Updated common functions from other plugins
* Use definitions from HighFSI, OsBytes, CMOS in place of local ones

Tested on a Risc PC (ie. VIDC style) and Beagleboard xM (ie. mixer style).

@Given a major overhaul to work with the HAL version of the SoundControl
module. Slider list is now dynamically generated to reflect hardware
capabilities. Configuration of beep voice and volume is now consistent with
the rest of !Configure (ie doesn't happen until you click 'Set').
