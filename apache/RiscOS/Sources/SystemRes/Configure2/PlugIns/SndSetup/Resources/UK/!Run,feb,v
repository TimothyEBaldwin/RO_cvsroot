@Move beep on error option into Sound Setup
Part of simplification of the window setup plugin.
Also, to avoid having to maintain two similar plugins, the differences from the former VIDC oriented Sound Setup are integrated
* If SoundControl module is running behave as before
* If no SoundControl but there is a VIDC, adapt to add
  + 16b/8b hardware option
  + oversampling option
  + don't permit muting of the (one and only) mixing channel
  + the mixing channel governs the *VOLUME and corresponding CMOS bits
* Updated common functions from other plugins
* Use definitions from HighFSI, OsBytes, CMOS in place of local ones

Tested on a Risc PC (ie. VIDC style) and Beagleboard xM (ie. mixer style).

@Fix null pointer dereference on startup. Pass command line options through to VIDC plugin.
Detail:
  c/main - Command line parsing now checks if enough arguments exist before attempting to look for an -openat option
  Resources/UK/!Run,feb - Now passes any command line options through to the VIDC-era plugin if we decide to launch that instead of ourselves

  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors

@Allow SoundControl-based sound setup plugin to fall back to VIDC-based plugin if SoundControl isn't present. Use AwkVers script instead of custom BASIC file.
Detail:
  Makefile - Modified to use standard AwkVers script to insert version number into messages file instead of the custom PatchVers script
  PatchVers,ffb - Deleted
  Resources/UK/!Run,feb - Updated to look for a copy of the VIDC sound setup plugin in !SndSetup.VIDC if SoundControl isn't present. This is a quick and dirty way of allowing the plugin to work on IOMD machines.

  Builds and runs, but functionality untested

1.2
log
@Given a major overhaul to work with the HAL version of the SoundControl
module. Slider list is now dynamically generated to reflect hardware
capabilities. Configuration of beep voice and volume is now consistent with
the rest of !Configure (ie doesn't happen until you click 'Set').

Note that, contrary to previous log message, this is still just the Phoebe
code base, but with build changes. The Ursula-RiscPC version is in
