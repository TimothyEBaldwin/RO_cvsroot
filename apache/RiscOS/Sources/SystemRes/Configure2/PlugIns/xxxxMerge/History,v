log
@Initial import of Configure plug-ins '!BootMerge', '!FontMerge' and '!SysMerge'
to CVS, this time in the correct place.

Note that !BootMerge and !FontMerge plug in to !BootSetup and !FontSetup
respectively, and all three plug-ins share the same source code.

1.1.1.2
log
@Fixed event ordering problems that became apparent when click-type window tools
were re-enabled in the Wimp. This involves a subtle alteration to the plug-in
quit protocol.
@
text
@a11 2
0.02	02/07/1998	BJGA	Fixed to work with click-type window tools
				(this required changes to quit protocol)
@


1.1.1.3
log
@SysMerge version number increased to 2.00 to avoid clashes with old SysMerge
applications. BootMerge and FontMerge versions also increased, to keep them in
line with SysMerge.

1.1.1.4
log
@Bugfix: if the user clicked Agenda then Merge, the log directory wasn't being
unset after the operation was complete. (Simple Merge operations were not
affected.)

2.01	14/10/1998	BJGA	Now unsets logdir after agenda merges
