@Import of theme setup plugin
The theme setup plugin ties together visual aspects of the desktop (behavioural ones are in the window setup plugin).
Absorbed options
 * desktop font (was previously in font manager setup)
 * protect built in icons (was previously in window setup)
 * 3D window outlines (was missing)
 * textured menus (was missing)
and also includes a picker for the current desktop theme. This requires a reasonably recent boot sequence which includes the theme loader (!ThemeDefs) and either a recent Wimp, or softloaded Wimp for pre-RISC OS 5 machines.

Version 0.03. Tagged as 'ThemeSetup-0_03'
