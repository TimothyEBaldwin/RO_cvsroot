1.3
log
@Addition of IDE disc spindown delay option from Steve.
Change to resources to accomodate the above.
Now also sets the attributes of the "DiscSetup" file to WR/r having
copied it from its "Blank" incase the Blank file got locked which would
have prevented any settings getting saved leading to a warning about it
being corrupt when !DiscSetup is next run.
