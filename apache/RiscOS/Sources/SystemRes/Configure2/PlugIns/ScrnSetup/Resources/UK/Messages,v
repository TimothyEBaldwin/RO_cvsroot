@Add support for EDID monitors in the system
Detail:
  Upgrade the MDF directory enumeration to minimally parse EDID data blobs. Add these to the list of known monitors. This allows a disc based MDF to override faulty data in the monitor, or on systems such as IOMD that don't support EDID, for them to benefit from a library of blobs rather than needing a parallel set of MDFs creating.
  Add the path of EDID blobs exported by ScrModes to those scanned for monitor definitions. EDID data is always placed in the top level manufacturer menu below 'Auto'.
  Add interactive help to clarify what 'Auto' means and how it differs from the EDID data.

  common.c: Relocate [un]grey_gadget() from screen.c.
  main.c: Simplify unnecessary memset(). Create a flag based on ScreenModes_Features whether the host OS supports EDID or not.
  monitor.c: Extra scanning. Conflict resolution if duplicate monitor definitions exist from differing sources. Simple EDID parser to get the monitor name (else default string) and DPMS flags.
Admin:
  Submission for the EDID bounty.
  Tested with ScrModes-0_61, and also on earlier versions, on RISC OS 5.23.
  Briefly tested on RISC OS 3.70 with !Boot.Resources.Configure.Monitors containing EDID data (should be ignored).

@Leave the selected monitor type correct after hitting 'Set'
When the monitor type is Auto at startup (type=3) and the user selects a monitor from an MDF (type=7) when pressing 'Set' the temporary instance of the ScreenModes module is killed off (in program_exit()) which restores the monitor type back to what it was when starting (type=3). That leaves DisplayManager thinking there's an MDF loaded, but the base instance of ScreenModes thinking not.
main.c/defines.h:
Minor unrelated clean ups.
monitor.c:
When saving the settings, kill off the temporary instance, apply the setting, then create a new one - this is much like adjust clicking on cancel does.
Complete a TODO with an error message if the settings file wont open.
Messages;
New error token for the TODO.

Fixes ticket #372.

@Minor ScrnSetup improvements
* Get OS_Byte/OS_File/filetypes/CMOS/OS_Module defs from header files.
* Fix ticket #312 (misuse of OS_GBPB means enumerating dirs on a non FileCore filing system could get stuck).
* Simplify the steps in the mode 'Try' sequence, now the mouse is bounded in the 'Keep/Cancel' message box (with the same 5s timeout) so that you can't click elsewhere on the main window. Previously, you could click 'Set', then the 5s would elapse and the mode revert to not the one you set.
* Window size is now compared with screensize on startup and the V scroll bar turned on/off as needed.

Note that in reviewing the plugins the minimum resolution considered to fit without scroll bars is 640x480, a special case is made of the screen setup plugin in case it starts in some mode less than that and you can't reach the 'OK' button to set it to anything else.

@Internationalised the screensaver blank times.

If no screensaver is set then adjustclicking on 'Cancel' now correctly restores the DPMS saver as the default.
Use OS_FSControl instead of OS_CLI(*COPY).
'Auto' and 'Unknown' put in messages file.

@Add framerate selection to ScrnSetup plugin. Update to take version number from VersionNum file.
Detail:
  c/main, c/monitor, h/defines, h/monitor, Resources/UK/Res,fae - Added an extra box to the display settings are to allow selection of screen refresh rate.
  Makefile, Resources/UK/Messages - Updated so that version number is taken from the VersionNum file instead of being hard-coded in the messages file.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix. New plugin seems to work OK with parsing both the old and new WimpMode lines, as well as when the PreDesk.Configure.Monitor file is missing altogether.
