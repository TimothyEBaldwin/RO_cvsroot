1.2
log
@  Corrected date comparissons, moved to using srccommit.
Detail:
  * Some date comparissons were using ints, rather than unsigned ints.
    Consequently, 50% of the time updates using the Installer module are
    not performed because they are deemed to be in the past. This fault
    is present in release versions of RISC OS 4 from ROL. It is not in any
    patch release.
  * Moved to using srccommit. I doubt this component will be used in
    future, but it's worth doing anyhow.
Admin:
  Tested with internal ROL builds.

Version 0.07. Tagged as 'Installer-0_07'
