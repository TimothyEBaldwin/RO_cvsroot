@   ArmBoot contains no Scrap.

   ArmBoot does a Net:Bye (somewhere).

   RO200Hook contains RO200 Fonts.

   RO310Hook contains NewLook (?).

   FloppyBoot contains no Configure, ARMovie, Fonts.

   ShareBoot contains no RO{200,300}Hook since ShareFS is for RO310 or later
   machines.

   Library.Repeat is made from BootCmds sources and installed here.

   Utils.PatchApp is made from Patch and installed here.

   SetupNet files now generated by SetupNet itself.

@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.

Version 0.72. Tagged as 'Boot-0_72'
