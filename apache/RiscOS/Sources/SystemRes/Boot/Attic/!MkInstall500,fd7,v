@Clearout and universality improvements
Still a work in progress, but the number of changes were getting above my "due for a checkin" threshold.
Highlights
* Import of skeleton RO400Hook (derived from prototype RO380Hook recovered from the archives).
* Clear out !ArmBoot junk, the aim is to have either a disc based universal boot or fileserver based boot (1 of 2, not 1 of 3).
* Import of RO370Hook scripts (derived from Acorn's universal boot CD).
* Generate DPMSUtils, WimpUtils, BandLimit, CDReinit from sources. Binaries deleted.
* Import of Ursula style sprites
* Combined SetChoices and NetChoices into 1, now in BASIC, allows more rational RAM disc creation in the case of a readonly boot (using SWI to discover how much RAM there is to apportion its size).
* Empty SetTheme added.
* Removed use of aasm, now use objasm, at least for those things still used.
* Trimmed source attributions from those files which get copied to the end user's output.
* Removed SetupMimeMap hack - this was only needed because the dopey MimeMap module goes dormant if Inet$Mimemapping is not set when it starts (which it isn't when in ROM), now the BootRun obey file deals with that case.

@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.
