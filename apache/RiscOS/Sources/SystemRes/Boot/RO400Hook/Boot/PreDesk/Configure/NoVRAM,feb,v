@Update to baseline Wimp version
Previously 3.98 (the nested Wimp supplied with the browser/Java CD), now 5.15.
While not wanting to belittle 117 versions, many of which were STB resource refinements, the main highlights are probably
 * 4.10 UTF8 support
 * 4.82 features contemporary with RISC OS 4.02
 * 4.84 support hires Sprites11
 * 4.85 support searching Wimp$IconTheme
 * 5.13 zero page safe and VFP contexts
 * 5.15 preset Wimp$IconTheme <-- that's the change !Boot was waiting for

RO310/350/360/370/400Hook: PreDesktop files updated to load the newer Wimp
RO430Hook: Unfortunately the ROM copy of the Wimp in 4.39 is already > the themed nested Wimp, but since the RO430Hook is only a skeleton (to allow softloading of RISC OS 5) there's little to gain by loading a Wimp
RO360Hook: Trim out licence from installed !Run file
RO400Hook: Reenable the default monitor definition in the NoVRAM case

Version 1.16. Tagged as 'Boot-1_16'
