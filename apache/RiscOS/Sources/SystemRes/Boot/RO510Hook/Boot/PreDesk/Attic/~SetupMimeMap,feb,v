@Ensure RO510Hook contains the new files that were added to RO500Hook, fix ResetBoot to not reset to RO500Hook
Detail:
  RO510Hook/* - These files were aded to RO500Hook yesterday, but needed adding to RO510Hook as well so that they actually get used on RISC OS 5.10+
  Makefile - Instead of containing a copy of RO500Hook, ResetBoot now has an empty Choices directory. This is the same as an ordinary (5.12) Iyonix, and will cause !Boot to reinstall the appropriate Hook folder on the next boot, ensuring the correct version is installed for the OS.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard.


Version 0.80. Tagged as 'Boot-0_80'
