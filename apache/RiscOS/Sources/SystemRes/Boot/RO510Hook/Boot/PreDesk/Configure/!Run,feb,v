@Adjust for VIDCBandwidthLimit and VIDCBandLimit
RO350Hook and RO360Hook these were still containing an obey file 'BandLimit' however the corresponding !Configure had been modified (for 3.7x) to instead use the alias VIDCBandLimit. Adjusted obey files accordingly.
RO500Hook and RO510Hook now use 'X' to supress errors when VIDCBandwidthLimit is absent. From RO520Hook onwards this can be removed permanently.
Additionally RO500Hook and RO510Hook were not running ClrMonitor so on a CMOS reset the (potentially wrong) monitor would be selected.
Updated comment in BandLimit/BandLimit.c.
Updated ClrMonitor/main.c to use central defines. Put old copy in attic to reduce confusion.

@Update BootVars to allow RISC OS 5.1x !Boot to be built from ROOL sources
Detail:
  Source/BootVars/c/main - Added kludge for missing service call definition in current ROOL sources
  Makefile - Updated to include RO510Hook directory. Fixed VProtect to use ${CPFLAGS} when copying.
  RO510Hook directory reconstructed by comparing RO500Hook directory against RISC OS 5 install CD.
Admin:
  Built on Iyonix, tested on beagleboard
