@Updates to hooks
Makefile produces RO520Hook too, corrected rule for RO430Hook.
Removed unnecessary 'IfThere' from RO500/RO510, both of which are HAL based so have never provided BandLimit.

@Re-reorder the theme loading (again)
By running !ThemeDefs in the desktop file, this was too late to influence the start banner. Moved earlier again.
To solve the problem of *ICONSPRITES and *TOOLSPRITES needing to be in the final desktop mode, the desktop file looks for some system variables and does the deferred load then instead.
Tested with and without 'Protect ROM sprites' turned on.

@Reorder when theme resources are loaded
Needs to be a little later on, after the desktop has been entered, in order that the pended *WIMPMODE command set in Choices:Boot.PreDesk.Configure has been acted upon (so any *ICONSPRITES commands know which is the best resolution to load).
Inlined the (optional) user setting of the theme, rather than unconditionally doing so in Choices:Boot.PreDesktop then having to go back and fix it up again later.
Tested with some different eigen factors with different sprite sets for each, to check the right one gets loaded.

@Further convergence
* RO310Hook is now created, but Boot removed (to halt booting on 3.10 until the assembler macros support ARMv2)
* 310/350/360/370/400 predesktop now define Wimp$IconTheme after loading the nested window manager
* 360 now has a default backdrop tiled sprite on entering the desktop
* 400/500/510 now demark sections of 'Desktop' with RISCOS - note, all one word. The installer relies on the lines being of the form '|Start <company> <program> 1.23 <detail>" with a space it would be mis parsed
* Recovered more recent patch for 3.50 from the archives
* Reordered BootRun so the hourglass is on before the (potentially slow) choices directory is cloned
* Added sprites for UserIF=Sovereign

@Update BootVars to allow RISC OS 5.1x !Boot to be built from ROOL sources
Detail:
  Source/BootVars/c/main - Added kludge for missing service call definition in current ROOL sources
  Makefile - Updated to include RO510Hook directory. Fixed VProtect to use ${CPFLAGS} when copying.
  RO510Hook directory reconstructed by comparing RO500Hook directory against RISC OS 5 install CD.
Admin:
  Built on Iyonix, tested on beagleboard
