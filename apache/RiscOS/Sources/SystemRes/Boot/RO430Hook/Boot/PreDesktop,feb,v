@Update to baseline Wimp version
Previously 3.98 (the nested Wimp supplied with the browser/Java CD), now 5.15.
While not wanting to belittle 117 versions, many of which were STB resource refinements, the main highlights are probably
 * 4.10 UTF8 support
 * 4.82 features contemporary with RISC OS 4.02
 * 4.84 support hires Sprites11
 * 4.85 support searching Wimp$IconTheme
 * 5.13 zero page safe and VFP contexts
 * 5.15 preset Wimp$IconTheme <-- that's the change !Boot was waiting for

RO310/350/360/370/400Hook: PreDesktop files updated to load the newer Wimp
RO430Hook: Unfortunately the ROM copy of the Wimp in 4.39 is already > the themed nested Wimp, but since the RO430Hook is only a skeleton (to allow softloading of RISC OS 5) there's little to gain by loading a Wimp
RO360Hook: Trim out licence from installed !Run file
RO400Hook: Reenable the default monitor definition in the NoVRAM case

Version 1.16. Tagged as 'Boot-1_16'

| When modifying the file by adding a section of lines it is recommended that
| the lines be bracketed by lines which start with |Start and |End. In this way
| it is easy to identify sections of line which shouldn't be broken up. For
| application writers who want to install a section of lines we advise that
| your company, application, version and section be identified. This enables
| a future install or update program to easily identify the section of lines

1.1
log
@Add skeleton hook directory for RISC OS 4.39
Largely a clone of the RO400Hook.
Also
* Update RO400Hook/ResetCMOS to have the right OS version at the end
* In each 'Desktop' file only Filer_Boot the utilities of the same major version number
* BootRun accepts RISC OS Adjust's extra default library prefix, but outputs a corrected Run$Path (where the CSD is checked before the Lib)
* Makefile and docs updated

Tested on RISC OS 4.39, booting to the desktop with no errors.
