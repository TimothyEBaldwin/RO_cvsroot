@More boot reorganisation
* BootRun no longer bothers checking for CallASWI, since the SharedCLibrary (which is loaded prior to BootRun) does this anyway.
* Try loading the StrongARM app patcher. Note the check is conditioned on 500 since it is assumed any application which has been 32 bitted is now also StrongARM safe, the use of 'X RMLoad' uses cunning on the placement of the PatchApp module in System:Modules.370, thus skipping the load on versions prior to StrongARM too.
* Remove redundant sprite sets from Extras/500 which were no longer being used anyway.
* Import of UserIF specific backdrop textures (Morris4 ones clawed off an old CD, others courtesy of Richard Hallas).
* Makefile rejigged to allow a TARGET=TEXTURES to select which UserIFs to add.
* Updated 'RTexture' to scan the configured theme for its random backdrop in addition to the generics.

@Clearout and universality improvements
Still a work in progress, but the number of changes were getting above my "due for a checkin" threshold.
Highlights
* Import of skeleton RO400Hook (derived from prototype RO380Hook recovered from the archives).
* Clear out !ArmBoot junk, the aim is to have either a disc based universal boot or fileserver based boot (1 of 2, not 1 of 3).
* Import of RO370Hook scripts (derived from Acorn's universal boot CD).
* Generate DPMSUtils, WimpUtils, BandLimit, CDReinit from sources. Binaries deleted.
* Import of Ursula style sprites
* Combined SetChoices and NetChoices into 1, now in BASIC, allows more rational RAM disc creation in the case of a readonly boot (using SWI to discover how much RAM there is to apportion its size).
* Empty SetTheme added.
* Removed use of aasm, now use objasm, at least for those things still used.
* Trimmed source attributions from those files which get copied to the end user's output.
* Removed SetupMimeMap hack - this was only needed because the dopey MimeMap module goes dormant if Inet$Mimemapping is not set when it starts (which it isn't when in ROM), now the BootRun obey file deals with that case.

log
@Restore a little universality
Makefile updated to use some shared bits.
New (empty) FILES510 definition.
Only !Sprites is mandatory for a given UserIF, !Sprites22 and !Sprites11 may be omitted.
Removed some heading blocks from files deposited on the user's disc.
Copied !Run into locale specific dir since it contains english translations.
Notes moved into Docs dir.
