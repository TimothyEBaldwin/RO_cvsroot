@Restore a little universality
Makefile updated to use some shared bits.
New (empty) FILES510 definition.
Only !Sprites is mandatory for a given UserIF, !Sprites22 and !Sprites11 may be omitted.
Removed some heading blocks from files deposited on the user's disc.
Copied !Run into locale specific dir since it contains english translations.
Notes moved into Docs dir.

@Handful of minor tweaks
* Spurious leading space for LCD14500 monitor definition removed
* Now redundant su_ banner sprites trimmed from Iyonix UserIF
* Source code comment block removed from !Run and !Boot, since they're copied to the user install

4.2

@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.
