;; Patch module for RISC OS 3.50

;; In RISC OS 3.50, the Wimp has two calls to the routine which conditionally
;; sets up the grey-scale palette. One of these (after a *WimpMode command has
;; been executed) has a bug in the addressing of the flag which determines that
;; a grey-scale palette is required. The location it actually reads is in the
;; system heap, in the second half of the kernel's 'TextExpand' block. The
;; second half of the block is only used in 16 million colour modes. If the
;; last text background colour set while in one of these modes was not black,
;; then the Wimp thinks it should set up a grey-scale palette. From then on,
;; any mode change done via the DisplayManager tries to select a grey-scale
;; mode, producing strange effects in 2-colour, 256-colour and
;; 32-thousand-colour modes. Doing F12 then RETURN temporarily clears the
;; condition, but any reselection of a mode from the DisplayManager returns you
;; to the naff state. It can only be cleared properly by reselecting a 16
;; million colour mode - from then on it is OK, because the default background
;; colour is black (although F12 sets it to be white).

;; This bug could arise if the user ran a program that selected a 16 million
;; colour mode and changed the text background colour. On return to the
;; desktop, the initial mode change would be OK, but subsequent ones selected
;; from the DisplayManager would be wrong.

;; The bug is fixed by this module, which on Service_ModeChange always pokes
;; the location in the system heap to zero, which is safe, since that part of
;; the block is only used in 16 million colour modes, and that location
;; defaults to zero after such a mode change anyway.

1.1
log
@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.
