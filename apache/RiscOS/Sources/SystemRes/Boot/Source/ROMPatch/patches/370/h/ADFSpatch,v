@Add ROM patches for the ADFS "disc error 20" fix
Detail:
  This set of changes adds a "disc error 20" fix to ADFS for RISC OS 3.50 thru 4.02, using similar code to that used for the fix that was applied to ADFS itself (in ADFS 3.54). This is to resolve issues with modern IDE devices which don't adhere to the DRQ timeout that old versions of the ATA spec mandated.
  File changes (all within Source/ROMPatch):
  - patches/s/ADFS354 - Generic assembler source for the disc error 20 fix
  - ihf2c/c/ihf2c - Source for a C utility that was used to help produce the ROM patch data
  - patches/adfs354,feb - Utility script for building the different versions of the ADFS patch and converting to ROMPatch form
  - patches/350/h/ADFSpatch, patches/360/h/ADFSpatch, patches/370/h/ADFSpatch, patches/371/h/ADFSpatch, patches/402/h/ADFSpatch - Added/updated ADFS patches
  - patches/350/h/patch, patches/371/h/patch, patches/402/h/patch - Include new ADFSpatch files where relevant
  - UK/h/messages - Update ROMPatch version numbers
  - c/rompatch, s/module - Add a word of writable workspace to the module which the ADFS patch can use
  - patches/402/h/CDSFTpatch - Remove duplicate patch (duplicate of RESLVpatch)
  - patches/402/h/MSGSpatch - Document the patches
  - ReadMe, Install/ROMPatch/!RunImage,ff8 - Remove redundant/outdated files (the main Boot makefile will build and install ROMPatch for us)
Admin:
  Tested on a RISC OS 3.70 StrongARM RiscPC with a CF-IDE adapter, disc error 20 is no more
  3.50/3.60/3.70/3.71/4.02 also tested under RPCEmu, manually provoking the different code paths to check hook points are correct

@Generate ROM patches from source
It looks like the source to the ROM patches got lost in one of the numerous reorganisations, so while "ROMPatch2" was here "ROMPatch3" including the crucial > 2GB drive lockup fix were lost.
* Reverse engineered ROMPatch3, see userdocs/v204/!ReadMe
* Added support to the patch tool for 2MB ROMs as used in RISC OS 3.50
* Convert the BASIC patch for 3.50 (in Sources/ROMPatch4M) into patch tool format, unfortunately it's not clear what all the patches actually do so they're mostly grouped by module with little explanation
* Removed source attribution from obey files copied to the user
* Use Push/Pull macros
Tested by applying the original patch to a ROM, saving it, then applying this patch, and diffing the result.
