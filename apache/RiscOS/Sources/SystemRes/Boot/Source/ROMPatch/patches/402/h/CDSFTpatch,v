@Add ROM patches for the ADFS "disc error 20" fix
Detail:
  This set of changes adds a "disc error 20" fix to ADFS for RISC OS 3.50 thru 4.02, using similar code to that used for the fix that was applied to ADFS itself (in ADFS 3.54). This is to resolve issues with modern IDE devices which don't adhere to the DRQ timeout that old versions of the ATA spec mandated.
  File changes (all within Source/ROMPatch):
  - patches/s/ADFS354 - Generic assembler source for the disc error 20 fix
  - ihf2c/c/ihf2c - Source for a C utility that was used to help produce the ROM patch data
  - patches/adfs354,feb - Utility script for building the different versions of the ADFS patch and converting to ROMPatch form
  - patches/350/h/ADFSpatch, patches/360/h/ADFSpatch, patches/370/h/ADFSpatch, patches/371/h/ADFSpatch, patches/402/h/ADFSpatch - Added/updated ADFS patches
  - patches/350/h/patch, patches/371/h/patch, patches/402/h/patch - Include new ADFSpatch files where relevant
  - UK/h/messages - Update ROMPatch version numbers
  - c/rompatch, s/module - Add a word of writable workspace to the module which the ADFS patch can use
  - patches/402/h/CDSFTpatch - Remove duplicate patch (duplicate of RESLVpatch)
  - patches/402/h/MSGSpatch - Document the patches
  - ReadMe, Install/ROMPatch/!RunImage,ff8 - Remove redundant/outdated files (the main Boot makefile will build and install ROMPatch for us)
Admin:
  Tested on a RISC OS 3.70 StrongARM RiscPC with a CF-IDE adapter, disc error 20 is no more
  3.50/3.60/3.70/3.71/4.02 also tested under RPCEmu, manually provoking the different code paths to check hook points are correct

@Update ROM patcher to understand Ursula kernels
The ROM patcher relied on lots of grubby internal knowledge of kernel addresses, some of which moved for Ursula
* L1PT now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* CAM now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* The StrongARM cleaner flipflop now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* Option to ignore the ROM checksum where it is known to be duff (eg. personalised copies of RISC OS 4)

Also
* Remove RO430Hook from the output pending more testing
* Readd SoundDMA for RISC OS 3.60
