@Update ROM patcher to understand Ursula kernels
The ROM patcher relied on lots of grubby internal knowledge of kernel addresses, some of which moved for Ursula
* L1PT now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* CAM now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* The StrongARM cleaner flipflop now discovered with OS_ReadSysInfo 6
* Option to ignore the ROM checksum where it is known to be duff (eg. personalised copies of RISC OS 4)

Also
* Remove RO430Hook from the output pending more testing
* Readd SoundDMA for RISC OS 3.60


Version 1.18. Tagged as 'Boot-1_18'
