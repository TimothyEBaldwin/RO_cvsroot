@Generate ROM patches from source
It looks like the source to the ROM patches got lost in one of the numerous reorganisations, so while "ROMPatch2" was here "ROMPatch3" including the crucial > 2GB drive lockup fix were lost.
* Reverse engineered ROMPatch3, see userdocs/v204/!ReadMe
* Added support to the patch tool for 2MB ROMs as used in RISC OS 3.50
* Convert the BASIC patch for 3.50 (in Sources/ROMPatch4M) into patch tool format, unfortunately it's not clear what all the patches actually do so they're mostly grouped by module with little explanation
* Removed source attribution from obey files copied to the user
* Use Push/Pull macros
Tested by applying the original patch to a ROM, saving it, then applying this patch, and diffing the result.
