Status of problems

The patches and/or fixes are as follows (patched means patched by this

Problem                                     Bug since  Patched for  Fixed since
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very slow printing over parallel port to    3.60       3.70         3.71 (note 3)
some HP printers (rarely provoked for
processors slower than StrongARM).

Occasional errors from behaviour of         3.70       3.70         3.71
STM {...}^ instruction on StrongARM
revision 2. (notes 1,2)

Wimp_TransferBlock can crash if called      3.70       3.70         3.71
more than once between Wimp_Poll's.

Wimp_TransferBlock can crash for large      3.50       3.60, 3.70   3.71
transfers and/or large Wimp slots.

Wimp_TransferBlock fails or crashes for     3.50       3.60, 3.70   3.71
transfers with address 2Gb or higher
(dynamic areas).

System centisecond timing reference and     3.10       3.60, 3.70   3.71
OS real time clock may run wildly fast or
slow for periods of 1 hour (RTCAdjust).

Floppy cannot be formatted if hard disc     3.60       3.60         3.70
is locked (FileCore and FSLock problem).


Notes:

(1) This patch is the same as that in the previous ROMPatch release, for
RISC OS 3.70 only.

(2) See TechNote for previously released details on this silicon bug.

(3) For prodution StrongARM Risc PCs and 7500FE A7000s
