ReadMe for ROMPatch version 2.02, 24-Feb-97
-------------------------------------------

This release of ROMPatches fixes some problems with RISC OS 3.60 and
with 3.70. It supersedes ROMPatch 2.01 for RISC OS 3.70 (and provides
additional patches).


Purpose of patches
------------------

The problems fixed are briefly as follows:

 1) 3.70:      Slow printing to some HP printers on parallel port. (Same
               as ROMPatch 2.01)

 2) 3.70:      Occasional "No stack for trap handler" on some StrongARMs
               (SA110, revision less than 3). (Same as ROMPatch 2.01)

 3) 3.70:      Errors from some applications using several in-memory
               transfers in succession.

 4) 3.60,3.70: Crashes for very large in-memory transfers between
               applications (typically more than 7 Mb, or smaller transfers
               from applications with very large Wimp slots).

 5) 3.60,3.70: Failure of in-memory transfer if the transfer involves a 
               dynamic area at a very high address (2Gb or more).

 6) 3.60,3.70: System centisecond timing reference can run a few percent
               fast or slow for periods of about an hour. The system
               real time clock correspondingly gains or loses time until the 
               next hour, or until a reset.

 7) 3.60:      Floppy discs cannot be formatted if the hard disc is locked.


Installing patches for RISC OS 3.60
-----------------------------------

If you have used any previous form of ROM patching for RISC OS
3.60, remove it from your !Boot first.

The patches are easily installed by copying the supplied Obey file
!!ROMPatch and the supplied directory (with contents) ROMPatch
into your

 !Boot.Choices.Boot.Tasks

directory. To do this, open !Boot by holding down the Shift key
while double-clicking on !Boot. Next, double-click to open Choices,
then Boot, then Tasks. Now drag !!ROMPatch and ROMPatch into
Tasks.

Finally, restart your machine to activate the patches. You will
notice a new dynamic area 'ROM patches 3.60/1' in the task bar
display, if you click on the Acorn iconbar icon.


Installing patches for RISC OS 3.70
-----------------------------------

The patches are easily installed by copying the supplied Obey file
!!ROMPatch and the supplied directory (with contents) ROMPatch
into your

 !Boot.Choices.Boot.PreDesk

directory. To do this, open !Boot by holding down the Shift key
while double-clicking on !Boot. Next, double-click to open Choices,
then Boot, then Predesk. Now drag !!ROMPatch and ROMPatch into
Predesk.

If you have used the previous release of ROMPatch (2.01), this will
update it.

Finally, restart your machine to activate the patches. You will
notice a new dynamic area 'ROM patches 3.70/2' in the task bar
display, if you click on the Acorn iconbar icon.
