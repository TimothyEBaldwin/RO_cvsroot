1.1
log
@  Made the FreePool utility capable of building stand-alone.
Detail:
  Added a Makefile to the FreePool utility sources. I also converted it to
  use objasm and changed the GET directives. The main Makefile has been
  changed to cope with FreePool using objasm.

  As it stands, the main Makefile has some dynamic dependencies. I've left
  the ones which are not related to FreePool in there.
Admin:
  My changes have brought the component under srccommit control, but I
  haven't bothered to do anything about the "Version" file in the root.
