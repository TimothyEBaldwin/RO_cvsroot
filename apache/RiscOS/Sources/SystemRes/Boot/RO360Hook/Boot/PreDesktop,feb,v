@Boot script fixes
When softloading the Wimp pre RISC OS 3.50 we must kill the BorderUtils module (which gets loaded as a side effect of the Toolbox being loaded when !System is run). While BorderUtils is careful not to fiddle with the workspace of Wimps it doesn't recognise this check is only made when it loads (which passes as the ROM Wimp is acceptable) but subsequent softloading is missed. Generally bad things happen when it pokes the Wimps workspace on every mode change.

PreDesktop scripts were trying to fix up malformed Boot$OSVersions, but since we know we get that right those steps are redundant.

In BootRun the use of AddToRMA hadn't spotted a subtle syntax change.
The AddToRMA utility ignored a trailing 'K' and assumed the number was always in kilobytes. AddToRMA in BootCommands requires a K (or M) suffix otherwise it assumes bytes. So for a number of years only 768 bytes have been added to the RMA, which isn't enough to softload a Wimp on RISC OS 3.10.
As RISC OS 3.10 has no free pool, the AppSize command drains the RMA dry. We push 256K back into it for any subsequent requirements (notably on RISC OS 3.10, sprites are held in the RMA, and the filer seeing some apps could trigger an annoying RMA full error message).

Disabled theme loading on RISC OS 3.10, there's really not enough free RAM to usefully load that many sprites.

Typo in RO310Hook/Boot/Desktop corrected.

@Update to baseline Wimp version
Previously 3.98 (the nested Wimp supplied with the browser/Java CD), now 5.15.
While not wanting to belittle 117 versions, many of which were STB resource refinements, the main highlights are probably
 * 4.10 UTF8 support
 * 4.82 features contemporary with RISC OS 4.02
 * 4.84 support hires Sprites11
 * 4.85 support searching Wimp$IconTheme
 * 5.13 zero page safe and VFP contexts
 * 5.15 preset Wimp$IconTheme <-- that's the change !Boot was waiting for

RO310/350/360/370/400Hook: PreDesktop files updated to load the newer Wimp
RO430Hook: Unfortunately the ROM copy of the Wimp in 4.39 is already > the themed nested Wimp, but since the RO430Hook is only a skeleton (to allow softloading of RISC OS 5) there's little to gain by loading a Wimp
RO360Hook: Trim out licence from installed !Run file
RO400Hook: Reenable the default monitor definition in the NoVRAM case

@Re-reorder the theme loading (again)
By running !ThemeDefs in the desktop file, this was too late to influence the start banner. Moved earlier again.
To solve the problem of *ICONSPRITES and *TOOLSPRITES needing to be in the final desktop mode, the desktop file looks for some system variables and does the deferred load then instead.
Tested with and without 'Protect ROM sprites' turned on.

@Reorder when theme resources are loaded
Needs to be a little later on, after the desktop has been entered, in order that the pended *WIMPMODE command set in Choices:Boot.PreDesk.Configure has been acted upon (so any *ICONSPRITES commands know which is the best resolution to load).
Inlined the (optional) user setting of the theme, rather than unconditionally doing so in Choices:Boot.PreDesktop then having to go back and fix it up again later.
Tested with some different eigen factors with different sprite sets for each, to check the right one gets loaded.

@Further convergence
* RO310Hook is now created, but Boot removed (to halt booting on 3.10 until the assembler macros support ARMv2)
* 310/350/360/370/400 predesktop now define Wimp$IconTheme after loading the nested window manager
* 360 now has a default backdrop tiled sprite on entering the desktop
* 400/500/510 now demark sections of 'Desktop' with RISCOS - note, all one word. The installer relies on the lines being of the form '|Start <company> <program> 1.23 <detail>" with a space it would be mis parsed
* Recovered more recent patch for 3.50 from the archives
* Reordered BootRun so the hourglass is on before the (potentially slow) choices directory is cloned
* Added sprites for UserIF=Sovereign
