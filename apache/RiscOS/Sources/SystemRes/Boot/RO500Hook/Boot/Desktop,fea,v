@Add skeleton hook directory for RISC OS 4.39
Largely a clone of the RO400Hook.
Also
* Update RO400Hook/ResetCMOS to have the right OS version at the end
* In each 'Desktop' file only Filer_Boot the utilities of the same major version number
* BootRun accepts RISC OS Adjust's extra default library prefix, but outputs a corrected Run$Path (where the CSD is checked before the Lib)
* Makefile and docs updated

Tested on RISC OS 4.39, booting to the desktop with no errors.

@Add helper to recalc iconbar bounding boxes
When 'protect ROM sprites' is turned off, and a theme is being loaded (after the desktop has started in order to pick the right eigen factor sprites file), the various built in ROM applications have already installed their iconbar sprites.
Therefore, when new ones are loaded the bounding boxes are wrong (eg. drive icons the wrong width, switcher icon too tall) and need recalculating.
Derived from 'FontChange' new configure helper 'IconChange' does this.

Also removed unnecessary 500/Tools22.

@Re-reorder the theme loading (again)
By running !ThemeDefs in the desktop file, this was too late to influence the start banner. Moved earlier again.
To solve the problem of *ICONSPRITES and *TOOLSPRITES needing to be in the final desktop mode, the desktop file looks for some system variables and does the deferred load then instead.
Tested with and without 'Protect ROM sprites' turned on.

@Reorder when theme resources are loaded
Needs to be a little later on, after the desktop has been entered, in order that the pended *WIMPMODE command set in Choices:Boot.PreDesk.Configure has been acted upon (so any *ICONSPRITES commands know which is the best resolution to load).
Inlined the (optional) user setting of the theme, rather than unconditionally doing so in Choices:Boot.PreDesktop then having to go back and fix it up again later.
Tested with some different eigen factors with different sprite sets for each, to check the right one gets loaded.

@Further convergence
* RO310Hook is now created, but Boot removed (to halt booting on 3.10 until the assembler macros support ARMv2)
* 310/350/360/370/400 predesktop now define Wimp$IconTheme after loading the nested window manager
* 360 now has a default backdrop tiled sprite on entering the desktop
* 400/500/510 now demark sections of 'Desktop' with RISCOS - note, all one word. The installer relies on the lines being of the form '|Start <company> <program> 1.23 <detail>" with a space it would be mis parsed
* Recovered more recent patch for 3.50 from the archives
* Reordered BootRun so the hourglass is on before the (potentially slow) choices directory is cloned
* Added sprites for UserIF=Sovereign

@Correction to Desktop files
The default run action for CMOS files was "/LoadCMOS" with "/" being a shorthand for run, which checks the run path and library (where the LoadCMOS utility is on old machines).
Since LoadCMOS is now in the boot commands module the "/" stops it working since the LoadCMOS utility is not supplied. This would still work without the "/" on a machine with no boot commands module too.

log
@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.
