@Adjust for VIDCBandwidthLimit and VIDCBandLimit
RO350Hook and RO360Hook these were still containing an obey file 'BandLimit' however the corresponding !Configure had been modified (for 3.7x) to instead use the alias VIDCBandLimit. Adjusted obey files accordingly.
RO500Hook and RO510Hook now use 'X' to supress errors when VIDCBandwidthLimit is absent. From RO520Hook onwards this can be removed permanently.
Additionally RO500Hook and RO510Hook were not running ClrMonitor so on a CMOS reset the (potentially wrong) monitor would be selected.
Updated comment in BandLimit/BandLimit.c.
Updated ClrMonitor/main.c to use central defines. Put old copy in attic to reduce confusion.

@Finally got round to storing this stuff.
Many changes,highlights being:
 freepool now creates its 'o' directory in the top Makefile
 safelogin tweaked so it can find its header files again
 stopped EXITS macro moaning about no ENTRYS in Appsize and AddApp
 added 2DTools to universal boot sequence
 Added RO370/400/500Hook though the 370 and 400 are just empty at present
 newer vprotect added from Alan Glover
 add Utils.NetChoices
 delete ~CDReinit binary,shuffle sources a bit
 misc changes to obey files from Steve
The Makefile now expects a TARGET to be defined.Currently the 500 one is
the only one tested,though UNIVERSAL is also defined and outputs a boot
sequence like you would have got with !MkInstall in V0.71.
This picks up files which might differ between boots,and also adds
extra files which change when the UserIF changes.
