@Boot script fixes
When softloading the Wimp pre RISC OS 3.50 we must kill the BorderUtils module (which gets loaded as a side effect of the Toolbox being loaded when !System is run). While BorderUtils is careful not to fiddle with the workspace of Wimps it doesn't recognise this check is only made when it loads (which passes as the ROM Wimp is acceptable) but subsequent softloading is missed. Generally bad things happen when it pokes the Wimps workspace on every mode change.

PreDesktop scripts were trying to fix up malformed Boot$OSVersions, but since we know we get that right those steps are redundant.

In BootRun the use of AddToRMA hadn't spotted a subtle syntax change.
The AddToRMA utility ignored a trailing 'K' and assumed the number was always in kilobytes. AddToRMA in BootCommands requires a K (or M) suffix otherwise it assumes bytes. So for a number of years only 768 bytes have been added to the RMA, which isn't enough to softload a Wimp on RISC OS 3.10.
As RISC OS 3.10 has no free pool, the AppSize command drains the RMA dry. We push 256K back into it for any subsequent requirements (notably on RISC OS 3.10, sprites are held in the RMA, and the filer seeing some apps could trigger an annoying RMA full error message).

Disabled theme loading on RISC OS 3.10, there's really not enough free RAM to usefully load that many sprites.

Typo in RO310Hook/Boot/Desktop corrected.

@Add helper to recalc iconbar bounding boxes
When 'protect ROM sprites' is turned off, and a theme is being loaded (after the desktop has started in order to pick the right eigen factor sprites file), the various built in ROM applications have already installed their iconbar sprites.
Therefore, when new ones are loaded the bounding boxes are wrong (eg. drive icons the wrong width, switcher icon too tall) and need recalculating.
Derived from 'FontChange' new configure helper 'IconChange' does this.

Also removed unnecessary 500/Tools22.

@Re-reorder the theme loading (again)
By running !ThemeDefs in the desktop file, this was too late to influence the start banner. Moved earlier again.
To solve the problem of *ICONSPRITES and *TOOLSPRITES needing to be in the final desktop mode, the desktop file looks for some system variables and does the deferred load then instead.
Tested with and without 'Protect ROM sprites' turned on.

@Reorder when theme resources are loaded
Needs to be a little later on, after the desktop has been entered, in order that the pended *WIMPMODE command set in Choices:Boot.PreDesk.Configure has been acted upon (so any *ICONSPRITES commands know which is the best resolution to load).
Inlined the (optional) user setting of the theme, rather than unconditionally doing so in Choices:Boot.PreDesktop then having to go back and fix it up again later.
Tested with some different eigen factors with different sprite sets for each, to check the right one gets loaded.
