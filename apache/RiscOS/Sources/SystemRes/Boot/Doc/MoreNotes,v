====

1. Start
The boot drive runs '!Boot' (ie. *OPT4,2), this in turn runs '!Boot.!Run'.

2. !Boot.!Run
Check not pre RISC OS 3.10.
Run '!System' (this loads a newer C library, FPEmulator, and CallASWI as needed).
It is now safe to run C code compiled as APCS-32.
BootVars sets up various 'Boot$' variables.
If this was run from the desktop (ie. double clicking on !Boot) '!Boot.Utils.DeskRun' is called.
If this was run from outside the desktop '!Boot.Utils.BootRun' is called.

3. !Boot.!Boot
This is ignored by the boot sequence, but will be seen by the filer later.
If the boot sequence is not run then on first being seen by the filer an error message will be shown reminding the user that stuff might not work.

3. !Boot.Utils.DeskRun
Selects a version of !Configure appropriate to the current OS.
Flow ends here.

4. !Boot.Utils.BootRun
Looks for a !Territory application.
Sets up some aliases for the pre-desktop section of the boot sequence.

5. !Boot.Utils.SetChoices (from !Boot.Utils.BootRun) 
Defines the 'Choices$' variables, creating a choices directory if absent, populating it will a default set of files from ROxxxHook.

6. Choices:Boot.PreDesktop (from !Boot.Utils.BootRun)

7. !Boot.Utils.BootRun
Set up a scrap directory.
Load (using Alias$@@LoadType for files accepted during the boot sequence) files from the Choices:Boot.Predesk directory.
Run directories from the Choices:Boot.Predesk directory.
Unset the predesktop aliases.
Enter the desktop. If the boot sequence has succeeded in running to this point the desktop will be entered regardless of the setting of the configured language. In the case of an error prior to this point, the default language is entered.

8. Choices:Boot.Desktop
By virtue of Choices:Boot.Desktop using the filetype &FEA the desktop is entered because the Alias$@@RunType issues a *DESKTOP command.
Filer boots any readonly resources in the ROxxxHook(s).
Filer boots any readonly resources in the !Boot.Resources directory.
Filer boots !Boot itself.
Filer runs everything from the Choices:Boot.Tasks directory, launching each one as a separate task.
Filer boots expected locations of applications in the standard disc image, if they exist, and any added specific ones added by the user.

9. Boot:Utils.HOff (from Choices:Boot.Desktop)
This doesn't use the *HOFF command, the hourglass must remain on until the desktop is idle, and the preceding steps in Choices:Boot.Desktop have potentially queued up a lot of things that need doing or that may take a while, whereas the *HOFF command in the Hourglass module is instant. 

10. Choices:Boot.Desktop
Some tidying up in case font/icons have changed, repointing aliases now that !Configure has been seen.
Flow ends here.

Main changes from Acorn UniBoot (part number 1215,602-03)
=========================================================
In !Boot.Library
----------------
AddApp, AppSize, Do, IfThere, LoadCMOS, Repeat, SafeLogon are all now in the BootCommands module.
This is consistent with the functional spec review (Docs.Review) section 3.12 which sought to reduce boot time and network accesses when these commands are hammered during the boot sequence.

An optional utility, PowerOff, is provided for those platforms with software controlled powersupplies. It can be deleted to save disc space if the user wishes.
 
In !Boot.SiteHook/MchConfig
---------------------------
These (empty) directories only appear on the fileserver copies of !Boot.

In !Boot.Utils
--------------
FreePool and AddToRMA is now in the BootCommands module.
CallASWI and CMOSUtils have moved into !System, previously the !System directory was not seen until later in the boot sequence so it was not possible to refer to 'System:Modules'. As !System is now seen in '!Boot.BootRun' for the C Library these modules have joined all the others.
VProtect has been retired as the commercial half of the virus protector is no longer available.
NetChoices and SetChoices have been combined into one.
UnplugTBox has been retired - unplugging ROM modules caused more trouble than it solved, now !System just RMEnsures a minimal working set of Toolbox modules when the C Library is updated. This must be done reasonably early on because clients of the toolbox can't be passed from one set of toolbox modules to another at runtime (error "Toolbox task(s) active").
PatchApp is now in Sys:370.Modules - it patches StrongARM incompatible apps, it is only loaded for versions prior to RISC OS 5.00 on the assumption that if StrongARM didn't kill you, 32 bit probably will have.
HOn and HOff - for turning on and off the hourglass. Later versions of the hourglass module include these commands by default. Note that HOff is actually a simple Wimp application, it waits for a null poll then turns off the hourglass.

Merging with RISC OS 4.0x/4.39
==============================
Skeleton support exists for these ROM releases.
The configure plugins (from RO400Hook.Res and RO430Hook.Res) will need to be copied over the top of the empty ones provided, these are not supplied for copyright reasons.

Merging with RISC OS 3.xx
=========================
Merge (using the !SysMerge obey file) the 26 bit !System resources with those already in !Boot, this adds a few missing modules that are in ROM from RISC OS 4 onwards. At some point this could be automated by combining ZIP files.

@Add skeleton hook directory for RISC OS 4.39
Largely a clone of the RO400Hook.
Also
* Update RO400Hook/ResetCMOS to have the right OS version at the end
* In each 'Desktop' file only Filer_Boot the utilities of the same major version number
* BootRun accepts RISC OS Adjust's extra default library prefix, but outputs a corrected Run$Path (where the CSD is checked before the Lib)
* Makefile and docs updated

Tested on RISC OS 4.39, booting to the desktop with no errors.

5. !Boot.Utils.HOn and !Boot.Utils.HOff
For turning on and off the hourglass. Later versions of the hourglass module include these commands by default.
Note that HOff is actually a simple Wimp application, it waits for a null poll then turns off the hourglass.
