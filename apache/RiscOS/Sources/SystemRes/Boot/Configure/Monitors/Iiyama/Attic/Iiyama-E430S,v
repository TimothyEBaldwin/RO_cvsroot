log
@Bulk MDF shuffle
45 of the provided MDFs used names that are ambiguous when copied onto a 10 letter long drive. Since the MDFs are already grouped in directories corresponding to the manufacturer name there's no need to prefix the filename with that same text. Removing the prefix gets them all under 10 characters.
Removed duplicate ViewSonic VA2012W and VA2012Wseries MDF.

@Import full set of MDFs from the offical Iyonix disc image
Detail:
  This change adds a load of MDFs to CVS that were in the Iyonix disc images but never in source control. The makefile has also been updated to simplify the MDF installation rules.
