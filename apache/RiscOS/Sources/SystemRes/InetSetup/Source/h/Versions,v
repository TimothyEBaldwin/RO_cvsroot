@Only ensure AUNMsgs when they're needed
When TCP/IP networking is disabled, but AUN or Access are enabled, the Internet module is loaded for its IP handling. In doing so, only load AUNMsgs if the Internet module to hand actually requires it.
Save.c:
  Check if the Internet module is new enough to contain its own messages, and don't load AUNMsgs if so.
Load.c/Versions.h/Messages:
  Populate v_InternetMsgs.
Main.h/Main.c:
  Turn the resolver types into an enum so the max value can be used instead of magic number 4.
SmallDrag.c:
  Don't look for Wimp_PlotIcon define, it's been in the headers for years.
UK/!Run:
  Simplify the check, !InetSetup doesn't need AUNMsgs itself.
Save.c/Routes/SetUpNet:
  Remove the hardwired version string of !Internet, since the files end up in Choices:, that way it can't be out of date ever again.

@Fix to work when DHCP doesn't support -p switch
The DHCP module uses OS_ReadArgs for switch matching, but in the CMHG table it strictly checks for max-args. The recently added '-p' switch therefore should not be output by !InetSetup when the available module doesn't support it.
Load.c: parse setup files with or without -p
Save.c: use RMFind() to figure out if -p is available, and omit it when not
Also
* Bumped up the !Internet version number in the comment block written out
* Make sure DHCP is plugged in during save (and unplugged if TCP/IP is actively disabled)
* Fixed the minimum DHCP version number, !InetSetup was always outputting -w even though that wasn't supported in the version that was being RMEnsure'd

@  DHCP support added.
Detail:
  The DHCP button in the interface configuration window is now unfaded
    as long as InetSetup can locate Internet 5.31 or later and DHCP
    0.11 and later.  Any number of interfaces may use DHCP to configure
    their interfaces,

  Tested in Risc PCs
