1.3
log
@Get focus right when opening AUN dialogue.
Was previously stuck at the window behind, so escape closed both.
Makefile recreated - now inserts version number into Messages at build time.
Some trivial warnings resolved.

1.1.2.1
log
@Now compatible with OSLib 4.8.

Ursula Configure plug-in interface added; updated sprites to Ursula design.

Windows now open from the position of the icon clicked on, as in the rest of
Configure.

In the AUN section (if any) of the generated Startup file,
   RMEnsure BBCEconet 0 RMReInit BBCEconet
is replaced with
   RMEnsure UtilityModule 3.80 RMEnsure BBCEconet 0 RMReInit BBCEconet
because there's no BBCEconet module in Ursula.
