@Delete a few !RunImages
Add CoSprite (rectangular pixel versions)
Docs and version number tweak

saving the settings.

28/10/96, from C.Elkins:

Variable Inet$EtherDevice was not set to any value in the output file,
so the *Set command failed (should write '""' after the variable name
to give it a null string).

  KJB: Fixed (check)

29/10/96, from C.Elkins:

When going to 'Save', get prompted that the machine will be reset -
but only have the choice of 'OK', instead of 'OK' and 'Cancel'. OK
acts like Cancel anyway.

Uses Podule_ReadInfo to check podule IDs, can't do that on 3.1.
