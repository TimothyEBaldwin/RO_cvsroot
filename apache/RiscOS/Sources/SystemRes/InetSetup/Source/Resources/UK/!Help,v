The blank User and Routes files were referencing some ancient !Internet.
The Resolver test expressions were using variables not registered for the Internet module, moved from Test$Eval to Inet$TestEval.
The !Help was missing some detail, added.

@Internet Setup
==============

InetSetup is used to configure the networking built into RISC OS.

Depending on the installed hardware, this may include:

    Acorn Econet (using the Econet or AUN protocol)
    Acorn Access (sharing files and printers with ShareFS)
    Internet (all protocols sent using the TCP/IP protocol)


Troubleshooting
---------------
You may find that some options are greyed out. This will be because some
required software has not been found in your ROMs or in your System
application. 

InetSetup is마ware of four of the available name resolvers:

    Resolve from Gnome Computers
    Resolver from ANT
    InetDB by Adam Goodfellow
    DNSResolver by Stewart Brodie

If InetSetup detects any of these in your System application it will allow
you to select one and configure it in the Hosts dialogue box.


What InetSetup does
-------------------
InetSetup scans both the ROM and the System directory of your computer to
find available network modules. It also autodetects network cards fitted to
your computer. It then offers configuration dialogue boxes for the available
network software and hardware.

When the Save button is clicked:

    1) InetSetup checks that all settings are consistent.
    2) Obsolete and duplicate network modules are unplugged.
    3) Required network modules are inserted if available in ROM.
    4) !Internet's configuration files are updated, if the TCP/IP
       Protocol Suite is enabled.
    5) A SetUpNet obey file is placed into your !Boot directory
       to ensure that the networking software is run on startup.
    6) You are given the opportunity to restart your computer.


Technical details
-----------------
InetSetup is hardwired with details of common network interfaces. To add an
unknown interface to InetSetup's interface list, place a detection program in
!InetSetup.AutoSense. All files in the AutoSense directory are run before the
InetSetup application starts. Your program should detect the presence of an
interface (independently of its driver module being present - it may be
unplugged), and for each interface present set a system variable

    InetSetup$Driver$<location>

<Location> is not significant, but is presented to the user in InetSetup,
with underscores converted to spaces. Example locations are "NIC", "Slot_4"
and "Econet".

The variable should be set to

    <description>:<unit>:<driver module>[:<version>[:<module filename>[:P]]]
      
where

    description = human-readable description of interface, eg
                  "Ethernet III"
    unit = DCI-4 driver name, eg "ea0"
    driver module = name of driver module, eg "Ether3"
    version = minimum version required for DCI 4.02 support, eg "4.21".
              If omitted, it is assumed that any version will do.
    module filename = filename of driver module in System:Modules.Network,
                      eg. "Ether3-16". If omitted, it will not attempt to
                      softload the module should it not be present in
                      ROM.
    P : if present, the interface is a point-to-point interface (PPP).

The required version numbers for the core networking modules are specified in
InetSetup's Messages file. If, for example, you have Net 6.18 in ROM, but
require Net 6.19, then you must set v_Net to 6.19 in the Messages file,
otherwise InetSetup, when used, will RMInsert the Net from the ROM, and not
cause the new Net module to be loaded on startup.

InetSetup currently generates the files Choices:Internet.Startup, and
<Boot$ToBeLoaded>.SetUpNet. The other files in the Choices:Internet directory
are intended to be manually edited.  Any changes made to the Startup or
SetUpNet files will be lost when InetSetup next runs.

@Add a live interface status/statistics view to the interface dialogue
This new button, 'status', to compliment the 'configure' button, shows various useful facts for an interface (packets, errors, link state, IP address) and updates every second.
Previously, obtaining this information required messing around with showstat or ifconfig at the command line.
