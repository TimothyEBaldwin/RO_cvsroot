@Resource updates
The blank User and Routes files were referencing some ancient !Internet.
The Resolver test expressions were using variables not registered for the Internet module, moved from Test$Eval to Inet$TestEval.
The !Help was missing some detail, added.

log
@Delete a few !RunImages
Add CoSprite (rectangular pixel versions)
Docs and version number tweak
The resolver setup will now try to RMInsert any unplugged modules when
saving the settings.
Change to DNS window so that it remembers the "Use name servers also" icon
rather than having two forgetful radio icons.

log
@* InetSetup is now aware that it needs to issue *ResolverConfig commands
  if a new-enough Acorn Resolver module is present in ROM and it changes
  pertinent Inet system variables.
* InetSetup now knows that Resolver 0.55 is the latest version to date.
  Application version number incremented to 0.26.  Probably it ought to
  be told about the latest versions of other stuff too, but I haven't
  done that.
