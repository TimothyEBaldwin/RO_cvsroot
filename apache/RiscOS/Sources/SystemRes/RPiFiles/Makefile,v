log
@  Initial import of RPiFiles component
Detail:
  This is used to place arbitrary files in Resources:$.Resources.RPiFiles
  which is useful for Raspberry Pi testing while there is no other way of
  getting files on or off the board. Adrian's version was a module for this
  purpose - I've changed this to copy files into the Messages module during
  the resources phase. Adrian also included !AWViewer and a couple of example
  ArtWorks files, but I've excluded these since they're not ours to
  distribute. You can add them back in (or add any additional files) by adding
  them to this component's Resources directory.
Admin:
  This is a resources only component, no code to test.

Version 0.01. Tagged as 'RPiFiles-0_01'
