Proceed along the main Swafford to Hardley road and turn left to Burfell
just before you reach Hardley. Continue along this road until you arrive at
a car park.

Go through a turnstile at the back of the car park and follow the footpath
past Garston Hall. Continue until you cross over the Burfell road and then
take the track that leads up into the wood. Once you are inside the wood
keep the fence on your left. If you're lucky, you may see some horses behind
the fence. Coming out of the wood take the footpath which passes by an old
ruined house. Continue for about a mile until you reach a picnic site. From
here you have uninterrupted views over the lake.

Leaving the picnic site take the path which climbs up, keeping Brooks Farm
on your left. Follow the ridge for about two miles. You will be able to see
Garside Fell in the far distance. The car park is now a few hundred yards
away.
