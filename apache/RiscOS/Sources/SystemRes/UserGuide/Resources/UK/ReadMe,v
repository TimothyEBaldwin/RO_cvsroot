@The directories DrawTutor and PaintTutor contain
the files used in the Tutorial sections of the
Draw and Paint chapters of the User Guide 
respectively.

The Pictures directory contains a small selection
of pictures stored in JPEG format to use while
familiarising yourself with Draw and Paint. The
original high resolution versions can be downloaded
from the Backdrops section of:

  https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common

and make great desktop backgrounds.

StarComms is a text file listing all of the 
commands in alphabetical order, referred to from
the appendix 'The command line'.
