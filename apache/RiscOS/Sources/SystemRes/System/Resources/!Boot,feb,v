@Readd 2nd iconsprites to !Boot
Having recently removed it, this no longer deals with the case when !System is run early in the boot sequence (to get the C library loaded for the rest of !Boot) at which time Wimp$IconTheme isn't set (unless the Wimp is in ROM).
This extra *ICONSPRITES ensures the icon is right after booting.

log
@Makefile ammended to not give up when USERIF=None
For generating !System we are careful to not include any sprites (because these would override the ones on the user's system which may not match the default USERIF for the build), this is achieved by locally passing in USERIF=None.
However, this then stops the install rule because it expands and fails to find a directory called 'None'.
* New dummy target created for install_sprites (as opposed to lots of IfThere commands)
* !Boot no longer iconsprites since it only calls !Run which does the same
* Removed !Mk as the all target did nothing useful

log
@Install alternate !System icons
To save a little disc space the default is the RISC OS 5 cream colour folder, hence only the deltas (Ursula and Morris4) are needed.
Also, !Boot moved out of UK directory.
