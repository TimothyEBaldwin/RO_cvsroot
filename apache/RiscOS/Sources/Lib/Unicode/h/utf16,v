@  Copyright message changes + changes from branch + Unified
   branched/non-branched builds
Detail:
  Copyright messages changed from E-14 to Pace throughout, filename
   placed at top of file throughout, instead of in just some files.

  Merged branch's fixes into our code base, plus made it possible to
   get nice debug output in branched tree, and vfprintf() to stderr in
   RISC OS tree.  Exactly same source used in branched tree now (apart
   from OS specific files riscos.c and unix.c moving into layers
   directory structure).

Admin:
  Built for branched, both Unix and RISC OS.
  Built in RISC OS tree, and compiled into TextConv.
