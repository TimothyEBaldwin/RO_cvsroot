1.1
log
@* Added support for ISO 6937:2001, and the variant with Euro used by DVB.
  (This isn't integrated with ISO 2022 processing though - it's standalone).
* Added a Dstroke -> Eth second-attempt conversion in various write routines,
  primarily for ISO 6937 -> Latin1 conversion (ISO 6937 unifies them).

Version 0.54. Tagged as 'Unicode-0_54'
