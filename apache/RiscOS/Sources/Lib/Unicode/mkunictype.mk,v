@Makefile recreated from fragments
Swap
 #if DEBUG
for
 #ifdef DEBUG
since the debug defines get appended to the non debug defines in the shared makefiles, so there's no way to set it to zero conveniently.
Requires BuildSys-6_63 for $LIBDEPENDS support.

log
@  Build fix
Detail:
  The build utility mkunictype, compiled at build time, is now built using the
  HostTools shared makefile, and so will execute on any RISC OS build host even
  if the default compiler options are to target an incompatible ARM
  architecture. Added call to stripdepnd to the MkClean obey file.
Admin:
  Tested using an APCS-R build on an Iyonix.
