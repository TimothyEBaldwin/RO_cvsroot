@Add encoding_read_in_multibyte_sequence API.
Detail:
  The new API allows the client to determine if a read codec has run
  out of input in the middle of a multibyte sequence. This permits a
  client to distinguish between the two cases in which no output
  character is generated:

    a) insufficient input has been provided to complete an output character
    b) the input consisted of a complete multibyte sequence which generates
       no output (e.g. an ISO-2022 shift sequence)
Admin:
  Tested using Iconv.

@  Fix bugs and inconsistencies in encoding handlers.
  Fix inconsistency in handling illegal byte sequences.
  Convert surrogate codepoints and U+FFFE, U+FFFF to U+FFFD.
  Also, a few extra mappings.
Detail:
  enc_utf8.c: 0x80 is a continuation byte. Map stray ones to U+FFFD.
              Reset the count of expected continuation bytes to 0 when
              encountering illegal byte sequences. Previously, if the character
              callback returned non-zero, this count would not be reset, thus
              leaving the codec in an inconsistent state. Additionally, we no
              longer consume the illegal continuation byte: instead, we process
              it as a start byte next time round.
  encoding.c: Do not load extension tables for ISO-8859-{1,2,9,10,15,16}
              If these are needed, it's probably best that different charset
              names are used rather than overloading 8859-n.
  iso2022.c:  Permit SS2/3 escape sequences for EUC encode/decode.
              Disable C1 characters for EUC encode/decode.
              Fix G94x94 read function to handle GR 0xA0/0xFF correctly.
              Fix writing of C1 controls for 8859-n.
              Prevent dereference of NULL pointer when scanning tables.
  iso6937.c:  Replace C99 loop iterators with C89 friendly versions.
  johab.c:    Fix final_only lookup table to have entries in the right place.
              Map 0x5C to the Won sign.
              Actually pay attention to encoding_WRITE_STRICT.
  shiftjis.c: Map 0x7E to overbar rather than tilde.
  textconv.c: Fix static assignment of stdin/stdout.
  unix.c:     Perform wildcard lookup of mapping tables.
  ccsolaris/Makefile: Modify for use with GCCSDK
Admin:
  Tested with the Iconv module testsuite.

@  Merge of bug fixes from NCBrowser tree.
Detail:
  Buffer overrun fixed; some buffer counting problems fixed too.  There is
    now helpful initialisation and tidyup routines you can call too (called
    encoding_initialise and encoding_tidyup)
Admin:
  I've built this with cc 5.45 in basic build environment - it built OK.
  This source code now matches that in NCBrowser 5.28.

@  More syncronisation with Unicode lib in branched tree
Detail:
  Added some changes from Unicode lib in branched tree.  All basically
   type changes.  This appears to be because other compilers are
   more picky about types than armcc.

Admin:
  Will add 0.46 VersionNum file into branched tree, and all will be
   syncronised fully.

   branched/non-branched builds
Detail:
  Copyright messages changed from E-14 to Pace throughout, filename
   placed at top of file throughout, instead of in just some files.

  Merged branch's fixes into our code base, plus made it possible to
   get nice debug output in branched tree, and vfprintf() to stderr in
   RISC OS tree.  Exactly same source used in branched tree now (apart
   from OS specific files riscos.c and unix.c moving into layers
   directory structure).

Admin:
  Built for branched, both Unix and RISC OS.
  Built in RISC OS tree, and compiled into TextConv.
