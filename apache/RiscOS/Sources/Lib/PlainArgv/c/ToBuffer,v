1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Note, the original makefile passed -DDesk__MODULE_CLIENT into the module variant, however inspection of Desk shows this just defines Desk__zm, neither of which are used in the library sources. To fit within the shared makefile scheme (which doesn't currently allow switches specific to library variants) this has been dropped.
Binary with and without the switch came out the same too.

Version 0.05. Tagged as 'PlainArgv-0_05'
