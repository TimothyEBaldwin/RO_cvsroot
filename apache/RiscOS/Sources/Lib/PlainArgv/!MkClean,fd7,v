1.3
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Note, the original makefile passed -DDesk__MODULE_CLIENT into the module variant, however inspection of Desk shows this just defines Desk__zm, neither of which are used in the library sources. To fit within the shared makefile scheme (which doesn't currently allow switches specific to library variants) this has been dropped.
Binary with and without the switch came out the same too.

1.2
log
@  Now suitable for release.
Detail:
  Removed dependence upon Every and Makatic tools, at least for the
  standard application and module builds. Makatic can still be used if you
  have it on your run path (and this will help if you want to create one
  of the debug builds).
Admin:
  Tested briefly in a ROM build.
