1.1.2.3
log
@Implemented ordered lists.
Implemented <Q> ... </Q>.
Caused a linebreak after </DD>.
Finished implementing attributes for <OBJECT>.
Stopped HTML after a </FRAMESET> leaking through.
Ensured that FRAME and FRAMESET tokens aren't passed up if not using frames.

Removed lots of unnecessary #include "utf8.h" lines from encoding files.
Ensured unsigned constants used in UTF-8 code.
Added UTF8_next and UTF8_prev functions.
