@Encoding support added (yippee). #define UNIFONT to get UTF-8 output,
otherwise Latin-1 output is provided. Lots of encoding files...

1.1.2.2
log
@Turned off CUSTOMER_SPECIAL.
Changed encoding tables to use FFFF as a null value instead of FFFD.
Added OBJECT support (more testing required - PARAM not yet done).
Added AREA support (commented out - MAP not yet done). They come out
looking like <A></A> elements.
Souped up mapping to Latin-1 (added lossy tables for Latin Extended
Additional, CJK Punctuation and Fullwidth forms).
Added support for <H1 align=...>
Stripped some superfluous whitespace caused by linefeeds.
Fixed missing linebreak in "<DT>One<DT>Two" by turning the second DT into
a BR.
Removed now unnecessary free(malloc(16384)) bodge.
Put in CJK code even if UNIFONT not defined (hey - why not?).
Added code to take direct pointer to table rather than loading it if
it's in ResourceFS.
Added support for encoding "x-acorn-latin1".
Ensured correct handling of OPTIONs when UNIFONT not defined.

1.1.2.3
log
@Implemented ordered lists.
Implemented <Q> ... </Q>.
Caused a linebreak after </DD>.
Finished implementing attributes for <OBJECT>.
Stopped HTML after a </FRAMESET> leaking through.
Ensured that FRAME and FRAMESET tokens aren't passed up if not using frames.

Removed lots of unnecessary #include "utf8.h" lines from encoding files.
Ensured unsigned constants used in UTF-8 code.
Added UTF8_next and UTF8_prev functions.
