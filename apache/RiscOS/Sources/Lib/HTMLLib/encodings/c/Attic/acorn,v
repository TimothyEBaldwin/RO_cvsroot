1.1.2.1
log
@Turned off CUSTOMER_SPECIAL.
Changed encoding tables to use FFFF as a null value instead of FFFD.
Added OBJECT support (more testing required - PARAM not yet done).
Added AREA support (commented out - MAP not yet done). They come out
looking like <A></A> elements.
Souped up mapping to Latin-1 (added lossy tables for Latin Extended
Additional, CJK Punctuation and Fullwidth forms).
Added support for <H1 align=...>
Stripped some superfluous whitespace caused by linefeeds.
Fixed missing linebreak in "<DT>One<DT>Two" by turning the second DT into
a BR.
Removed now unnecessary free(malloc(16384)) bodge.
Put in CJK code even if UNIFONT not defined (hey - why not?).
Added code to take direct pointer to table rather than loading it if
it's in ResourceFS.
Added support for encoding "x-acorn-latin1".
Ensured correct handling of OPTIONs when UNIFONT not defined.
