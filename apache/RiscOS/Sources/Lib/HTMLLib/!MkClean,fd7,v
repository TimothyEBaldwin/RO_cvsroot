1.3
log
@  Brought under srccommit control. Dependencies stripped on cleaning.
Detail:
  !MkClean now runs StripDepnd on the Makefile. VersionNum file is
  used to implement a new "HtmlVersion" call (which just returns the
  Module_HelpVersion string).
Admin:
  !MkClean tested. HtmlVersion call not tested.

Version 0.01. Tagged as 'HTMLLib-0_01'
