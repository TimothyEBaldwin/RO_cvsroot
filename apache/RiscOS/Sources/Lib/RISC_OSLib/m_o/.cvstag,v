1.1
log
@  Changes required for Customer W.
Detail:
  * Implemented the thread-safety mutex macros for the user mode heap.
  * Created ansilibm, a version of ansilib suitable for building modules.
  * Fixed an overestimation of the size of the workspace passed to
    SharedCLibrary_LibInitModule[APCS_32] by the stubs.
  * Fixed bug in SharedCLibrary_LibInitModule[APCS_32] regarding handling of
    non-reentrant modules - if module code was at a higher address than the
    module data, then all the intervening data would be pointlessly copied
    back over itself with no allowance for volatility.
  * Removed the bsearch source file, since it was only required for APCS-A
    which the library has not supported since the year 2000, and which the
    compiler is now no longer able to build.
Admin:
  ansilibm builds working modules, but thread safety has not been
  extensively tested.

Version 5.47. Tagged as 'RISC_OSLib-5_47'
