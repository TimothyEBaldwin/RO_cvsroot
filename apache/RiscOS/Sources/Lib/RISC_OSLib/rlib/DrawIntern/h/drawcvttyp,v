@Rationalize C include path usage
 Detail:
  Parts of RISCOS_Lib use non-standard paths that only really work on native RISC OS compilitation.
  This moves the relevant files into a more normalized dir.h.file format.
 Admin:
  Not tested yet.  #include path changes to follow.

Version 5.54. Not tagged

 * Type conversion between external and internal worlds.

 * History:
 * Version 0.0: 22 Nov 88, DAHE: created
 * Version 0.1: 23 Nov 88, DAHE: first working version
 *
 * At present the implementations of the two worlds are the same, so we just
 * use typedef to construct equivalences. If either implementation changes in
 * the future, we will need a thin layer of type conversion instead.
