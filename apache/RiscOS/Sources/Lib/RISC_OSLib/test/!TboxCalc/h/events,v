1.1
log
@  Misc changes.
Detail:
  * Improved lookup of application Sprites file: uses Wimp_Extend 13 (in
    Wimps that support it) to work out the appropriate resolution suffix,
    and prefixes with "<Wimp$IconTheme>" to allow a future Theme Manager
    to operate.
  * Preserves attributes of any existing file when saving sprite or text
    files.
  * Changed two null menu handles from 0 to (doucmented) -1. Despite the
    fact that the Wimp is actually happy with 0 as a null handle here,
    this was reported as a fault.
  * Changed rlib.c.version to use VersionNum, deleted thereby-obsoleted
    rlib.h.VerIntern.version file. Not that rlib.c.version seems to be used
    at the moment.
  * Added Kevin's additions to the test directory.
Admin:
  Tested briefly.
