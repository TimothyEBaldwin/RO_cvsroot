1.1
log
@  Email/Common library now has object code for linking with as well has the
  current type definitions provided in headers.

  Common library now defines the base class - Version - which provides a
  generic class interface to the version information provided by srccommit.
  Other components then derive and implement a singleton class from this
  Version class,
    ie. for Common library: CommonVersion class
  and setup this singleton object with the data from the srccommit
  VersionNum file.

  These singleton objects provide a common interface to all components to
  obtain their version information at runtime.

  See the Detail section below, the VersionDef.h header file and the
  Version.h and CommonVersion.c++ files as an implementation example
  - CommonVersion.c++ implements this library's Version singleton object.
Detail:
  Version singleton objects have been added to NetLink, Mailbox and
  EmailLib librarys and will be added to the Engine and UI components of
  !NCMail.  This will allow the NCMail app. at runtime to easily display
  the version information of all the components within it.

  Each Version singleton object follows the naming convention:
    [COMPONENTNAME]Version
  and provide the 'Instance' static method to obtain the instance of the
  singleton object.  The base class Version methods can then be used on the
  instance to obtain version information.

  eg. In your app, doing something like:

    void DoVersion(Version* instance)
    {
      printf("Name         : %s\n", instance->Name());
      printf("VersionNumber: %d\n", instance->VersionNumber());
      printf("MajorVersion : %s\n", instance->MajorVersion());
      printf("MinorVersion : %s\n", instance->MinorVersion());
      printf("Date         : %s\n", instance->Date());
    }
    .
    .
    ...
    DoVersion(NetLinkVersion::Instance());	// Display NetLink  version
    DoVersion(MailboxVersion::Instance());	// Display Mailbox  version
    DoVersion(EmailLibVersion::Instance());	// Display EmailLib version
    DoVersion(CommonVersion::Instance());	// Display Common   version
  Currently, this is all C++.  However, a C veneer API could be added at
  a later date if required.
  File Changes
  ------------
  h.Version
    Created.  Defines the CommonVersion class - the Version singleton object
    for this library.
  h.VersionDef
    Created.  Defines the base Version class.
  c++.CommonVersion
    Created.  Implements the CommonVersion singleton class.  Uses the
    srccommit VersionNum file for version details.
  c++.VersionDef
    Created.  Implements the base Version class.
  Makefile
    Changed to Ben's cunning 2 level makefile for multiple builds.
  MainMake
    Created to implement Ben's cunning 2 level makefile system for multiple
    builds.
  !MkClean
    Created.
  !MkDebug
    Created.  Builds Commond - DDT build.
  !MkExport
    Modified for new makefiles
  !MkHP
    Created.  Builds CommonHP - HierProf build.  Has function names embedded
    for use by HierProf.
  !MkMC
    Created.  Builds CommonMC - MemCheck build.
  !MkMcCabe
    Created.  Outputs preprocessed files into i directory for input into
    McCabe tools.
Admin:

#define Email_Common_versiondef_h

/* File:    versiondef.h
   Purpose: Base class Version class definition
            This defines the base Version class from which all other Version
            classes are derived.  The convention is that all components will
            implement a derived Version class, defined in a header file
            called "Version.h".  The name of the derived class will be the
            same as the component name.  eg. EmailLib for the Email/EmailLib
            component.
            The implementation file (c++) must not be called Version.c++ as
            CFront uses file names for namespacing the virtual table and
            therefore, if you have in a compliation, source files of the
            same name, you get virtual tables of the same name, and the link
            fails.  Therefore, the convention is that the implementation file
            should be the component name with Version appended,
            eg. EmailLibVersion.c++

            The derived classes must define a public static member called
            VersionInstance which returns the instance of the object to use:
            eg.
               static Version* VersionInstance(void);
            a private static data member _instance
            eg.
               static [COMPONENTNAME]Version* _instance;
            and a Constructor which sets up the data members
            eg.
               [COMPONENTNAME]Version::[COMPONENTNAME]Version()
                               :Version(lib_name,
                                        Module_MajorVersion,
                                        Module_MinorVersion,
                                        Module_Version,
                                        Module_Date)
               {
               }
            The lifetime of the passed char*'s must be for the whole lifetime
            of the library as Version class does not take a copy.

               Version* [COMPONENTNAME]Version::VersionInstance(void)
               {
                 if (_instance == 0)
                   _instance = new [COMPONENTNAME]Version();

                 return _instance;
               }
