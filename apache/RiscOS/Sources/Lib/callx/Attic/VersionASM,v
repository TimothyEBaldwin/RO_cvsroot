@Add the ability for a callback to be run with interrupts disabled
Detail:
  c/callx, h/callx, s/veneer - Added new callx_add_callback_irqsoff function.
  This is identical to callx_add_callback, except the callback function will be entered with IRQs disabled.
  Using this function makes it safe to cancel callbacks from interrupts, as there's no longer the chance of a callback firing after it's been deleted.
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM.

@  * Fixed potential problem with removing an executing callback from within a
    callafter or callevery handler.
  * Performance improvements.

Detail:
  * There was a small opportunity at the start of the assembler veneer for a
    callafter or callevery to interrupt a callback that had just gone off (this
    window was only about one or two instructions).  If the callafter/callevery
    handler deleted the executing callback then once the callback resumed
    processing it would have tried to access data from the free'd callback data
    structure, and then would have tried to free this structure again.

  * Each call to add a handler used to result in malloc being called to
    allocate an internal data structure.  A few of these data structures are
    now preallocated on initialisation, hopefully avoiding the need for calls
    to malloc/free in most circumstances.

Admin:
  Tested (last summer!) using a little test-harness module, and tested today
  using AcornPOP3 test harness to fetch all the headers from my INBOX.  Seems
  to work.

  Apologies to Dan - I'd already done the 32 bit stuff but hadn't got around
  to checking this in because I wanted to do more testing.  However, I'd missed
  the fact that 32 bit PHPSEI wants a scratch register, so it wasn't in vain.

@ Fixed for 32 bit

Details:
 callx creates a veneer in assembler which makes using callafter,
callevery and callback easier from a C module.  This used some
non-32bit compatible code.

 Tested in build of USB prototypes on Customer L board.

log
@Summary
  * Uses AsmUtils for control of interrupts.
  * Miniscule performance improvement.
Detail
  * The code in the veneer that sets up the return address before calling
    the client's handler had a redundant instruction, which has now been
    removed.  This instruction was effectively compensating for its own
    presence :).
Admin
  * Compiled and tested on a Risc PC using AcornPOP3, which uses this library.
  * Modules which use this library must now also link against AsmUtils.
