1.1
log
@  err functions can handle floating point if FPEmulator is present.
  ELF header file updated to reflect revision B-01 of ARM's document.
  ELF hash function added.
  Fixed a missing return value in wf_rename.
Detail:
  The err_* functions could not previously handle floating point values
    being passed in the variadic arguments.  This restriction is now
    removed from the library and responsibility placed on the caller to
    ensure that floating point hardware/emulator is present if using FP
    arguments to these functions.
  ARM have released SWS ESPC 0003 B-01 - the ARM ELF specification.  The
    header file elf.h has been updated with the new relocation types as
    defined in that document, except for R_ARM_ALU_PCREL_23_15 which has
    been entered as R_ARM_ALU_PCREL_23_16 as this is an obvious mistake
    in the documentation.
  Added a new source file (elf.c) which contains the ELF hashing function.
Admin:
  Built.
  Required by link 5.26 and later (probably)

Version 1.27. Tagged as 'CLX-1_27'
