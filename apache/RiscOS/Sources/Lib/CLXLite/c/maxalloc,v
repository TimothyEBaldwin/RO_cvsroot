@Makefile tweak

Resolve a couple of trivial warnings in the code.
Build, but not tested.

1.1
log
@  Various changes from Kevin.
Detail:
  Reinstatement of old CLX library files libflfmt and maxalloc
  Ensures that at least one space follows even really long diassembled opcodes
  Bugfix to floating point rounding
  Various extra defines and structs in h.asdfmt and h.ieeeflt
Admin:
  Presumably used for C 5.53 / 5.54 releases.
