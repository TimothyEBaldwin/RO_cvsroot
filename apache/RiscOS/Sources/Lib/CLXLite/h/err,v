@  Partial release of CLX ("C Library eXtension") library
Detail:
  The original CLX library was an ad-hoc collection of functions shared
  between the sources for multiple tools. Ownership of the original source
  files is now spread between Castle, ARM, Codemist, AT&T and Alcatel, making
  release a licensing nightmare. However, without at least some of these
  source files it is impossible to build various RISC OS specific tools, so
  making it of little use to release the source code thereof.
  To facilitate the release of the most unique tools, we have therefore
  taken the following steps:
  * Evaluated which source files are untainted by non-Castle ownership
    and released them complete with CVS history. This applies to files named:
      dir elf filestamp hash host libflfmt mapping maxalloc pathmacro re
      symdefs wildcard
  * Done a cleanroom rewrite of other particularly critical files:
      bytesex err prgname wholefls
  * Withheld the remaining source files from release
  * Written a new set of build scripts
  With this cut-down version of CLX, which we're calling CLXLite to avoid
  confusion internally within ROOL (we still need the complete version in
  order to build the C tool suite) it should be possible to release:
    chmod diff find modsqz romlinker squeeze srcbuild unmodsqz xpand
Admin:
  Builds all the above tools, but they are currently untested

Version 2.00. Tagged as 'CLXLite-2_00'
