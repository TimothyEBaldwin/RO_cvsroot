1.2
log
@  Added pathmacro source.
  Added hash_destroy.
Detail:
  The pathmacro source file exports a single function for resolving
    RISC OS pathnames on whatever the host system is.  For example, this
    means that provided the environment variable HdrPATH is set to point
    to the appropriate directories, then "Hdr:RISCOS" will be resolved
    to the full pathname that can be passed to fopen et al.
  hash_destroy function added to enable hash tables to be destroyed.
    Each associate value is passed to a supplied callback function to
    permit each value to be freed.  Usually this will be NULL (no action)
    or the address of the library function free unless a private allocator
    has been used by the caller.
Admin:
  Tested on RISC OS and Solaris.
