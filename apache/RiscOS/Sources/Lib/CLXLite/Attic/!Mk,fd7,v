@Makefile tweak
CLibrary now includes the others itself so we don't have to.
Resolve a couple of trivial warnings in the code.
Build, but not tested.

1.1
log
@  Changes to facilitate platform independence.
Detail:
  * Added shell-script make wrapper
  * Removed Norcroft-specific options from Makefile
  * Added GCC equivalents of inline assembler
  * Force use of our kernel.h with GCC (its own one is incomplete)
  * Workarounds to allow full-fat CLX library to use shared makefiles
Admin:
  Tested by rebuilding the DDE tools
