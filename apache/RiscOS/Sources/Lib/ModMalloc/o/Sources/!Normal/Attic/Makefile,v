1.1
log
@  Now suitable for release.
Detail:
  Removed dependence upon Every and Makatic tools, at least for the
  standard application and module builds. Makatic can still be used if you
  have it on your run path (and this will help if you want to create one
  of the debug builds).
  All references to the MemCheck library (also part of WSS's commercial
  product Dr Smith's Toolkit) are now wrapped in #ifdefs, and so the library
  can now be built without it.
Admin:
  Tested briefly in a ROM build.
