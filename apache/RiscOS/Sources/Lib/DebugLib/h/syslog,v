1.1
log
@  Adding SysLog and Reporter logging backends to the DebugLib library.
Detail:
  I've added simple backends for the standard SysLog SWI interface and
  the Reporter module. Both of these provide line based APIs so the output
  is line buffered (to a width of 80 characters). I also removed two
  unnecessary forward declarations for static functions in debug.c which
  were producing warnings from Norcroft CC.
Admin:
   Compiled with Norcroft 5.65. Tested on RISC OS 5.13, using DoggySoft
   SysLog 0.20, Reporter 2.64d via a debug build of the USBDriver module.

Version 0.64. Tagged as 'DebugLib-0_64'
