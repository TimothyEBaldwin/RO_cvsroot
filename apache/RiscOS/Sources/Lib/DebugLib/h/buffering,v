@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

1.4
log
@ * Continued tidy-up of DebugLib:

 * All DebugLib functions now namespaced, they all start debug_<filename>_
  (except the functions in debug.c which are debug_).

 * Device specific #defines etc moved into device specific header files,
   e.g. debugit.h

 * Moved taskname prefixing to a central location, moved timestamping here
   also, added area/level prefixing, and tidied up this prefixing to make
   sure it looks good on all the possible debug devices.

 * Can now do any debuglib function to any debug device, including trace
   output, this hasn't been the case for a while.

 * Added new option, to set whether you want to prefix all debug lines
   with the area/level pair specified in dprintf, dfprintf etc.  Added
   new function to set this option.  debug_set_area_level_prefix ()

 * remotedb output now uses new "raw" output mode added to remotedb in
   version 0.06.  _DebugLib now requires remotedb version >= 0.06_

 * Added new test cases into CLI_App test harness, and changed a few things
   in TestMod.

 * Added Memcheck misc block registration into buffering code, which allows
   buffering to be used on the DebugLib Memcheck build.

 * Added lots of new function names into the always_ignore field which is
   used to tell trace which functions to ignore.  It seems that some the
   internet libraries have function names emebedded, which causes horrible
   loops when using DebugLib to output trace info to remotedb.  Also added
   debug_* and remote_debug_*

 * Added StrongHelp topics for ddumpbuf, debug_output_buffer_* and
   debug_set_area_level_prefix.  Updated the "Setting up the library"
   section.

 * Checked with all the debug devices except TML and serial.

1.3
log
@ * Continued tidy of DebugLib structure/implementation...added an "Open"
   variable to the debug_output_method structure, to replace the
   sessions_available struct that was used previously.  Now check for
   whether a device is open at the top level (debug.c) instead of once
   for each device.  Removed the "quit" function for a few devices, because
   it was doing nothing.
 * Reduced global variable count to 1. :)

 * Split option setting functions to options.[ch], left debug_set_device
   in c.debug, as it does a bit more that just set an option.

1.2
log
@ * Overhauled how DebugLib options are handled.  Options are now held in
   an options structure internal to DebugLib.  Options are set one at a
   time by function calls, this makes it much easier to add new options
   over time.  debug_set_options and debug_output_device now deprecated,
   but still provided.  Updated StrongHelp manual to document this
   new behaviour.

 * Fixed trace output somewhat...should now look better on remotedb
   output (no extraneous CRs), and you can now set the trace device to
   be the same as the main debug device.  Setting trace device to "printf"
   now also works (file still to do, as you still can't "dfprintf" to file)

 * Added one of the new options function calls to the CLI_App test harness,
   to test functionality.

 * Improved the !MkCleans for the test harnesses.

log
@--------
  * Added buffering support.
Detail:
-------
  * DebugLib output can now be buffered and then output.  This is primarily
    for debugging ROM modules that would be active before the parallel
    port is alive during boot up.  Two new functions have been added to
    support this; debug_output_buffer_on() and debug_output_buffer_off().
    Updated documentation to follow.
Admin:
------
  * Tested on RiscPC/NC with Parallel, DebugIt and System variable
    override of output settings.
