@  More boolean type changes.
Detail:
  More drastic changes to try and fix all the wonderful variants of
   the boolean type.

  DebugLib now uses <stdbool.h>, "bool", "false" and "true"
   internally.

  DebugLib.h now prototypes its functions with the type DebugLib_BOOL,
   and does preprocessor jiggery-pokery to try and ensure that
   it, plus TRUE, FALSE and BOOL get defined as something appropriate.
Admin:
  Tested by changing some of the test harnesses to include OSLib,
   stdbool and tboxlib headers.
  Fixed test harness module Makefile to include zm versions of
   libraries in all cases.

@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

log
@ * Improved DebugLib's area handling system.  Lines of debug may now belong
   to multiple "areas" of code, each at a specific level.  The filtering of
   debug at runtime is now done with a much more flexible system,
   areas/levels are masked in/out based on a new format for the
   DebugLib$Level_<taskname> system variable.  The description of this
   format has not made it into the StrongHelp document, it will go into
   this, and into the DebugLib web docs ASAP.

 * Added a new option to allow the area/level prefix in debug output to
   be padded to a particular width.  This makes the prefix much more
   useable.  The prefixing is turned on with the option
   "debug_set_area_level_prefix", and the padding controlled with
   "debug_set_area_pad_limit".

 * Added test cases for new levelling scheme into CLI test harness.

 * Updated StrongHelp manual somewhat.

log
@Summary
-------
  * Initial checkin of code to allow data to be output in a raw form.
  * Added copyright messages to DebugLib.h (the exported header) as
    DebugLib has now been shipped to one customer.
Detail
------
  * Two new functions debug_set_raw_device() and dprintf_raw() have been
    added to debug.c.  This allows debug data to be output unprocessed;
    i.e. without taskname prefixing, timestamping etc.  This was done for
    HierProf, MemCheck and McCabe.  This is especially important for McCabe
    as no formatting must be done to the output generated by the program.
    Subject to testing against McCabe, it will be possible to send output
    for analysis via any debug stream (except RemoteDB due to the nature
    of the daemon).  DebugLib$RawDevice_<taskname> can be used to override
    debug_set_raw_device().
Admin
-----
  * Tested that the data is output in a raw form.  Testing with McCabe
    not yet accomplished.

@ * Tidied "include.h":

 * Moved non-general definitions into appropriate
   header files.  e.g. Default serial options into serial.h etc.
 * Removed DEBUGLIB_UNUSED() macro, as there was already a similar macro
   IGNORE()

 * "globals.h" now includes "options.h" to get the definition of the
   options structure.

1.1
log
@ * Continued tidy of DebugLib structure/implementation...added an "Open"
   variable to the debug_output_method structure, to replace the
   sessions_available struct that was used previously.  Now check for
   whether a device is open at the top level (debug.c) instead of once
   for each device.  Removed the "quit" function for a few devices, because
   it was doing nothing.
 * Reduced global variable count to 1. :)

 * Split option setting functions to options.[ch], left debug_set_device
   in c.debug, as it does a bit more that just set an option.
