@  More boolean type changes.
Detail:
  More drastic changes to try and fix all the wonderful variants of
   the boolean type.

  DebugLib now uses <stdbool.h>, "bool", "false" and "true"
   internally.

  DebugLib.h now prototypes its functions with the type DebugLib_BOOL,
   and does preprocessor jiggery-pokery to try and ensure that
   it, plus TRUE, FALSE and BOOL get defined as something appropriate.
Admin:
  Tested by changing some of the test harnesses to include OSLib,
   stdbool and tboxlib headers.
  Fixed test harness module Makefile to include zm versions of
   libraries in all cases.

@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

1.5
log
@ * Continued tidy-up of DebugLib:

 * All DebugLib functions now namespaced, they all start debug_<filename>_
  (except the functions in debug.c which are debug_).

 * Device specific #defines etc moved into device specific header files,
   e.g. debugit.h

 * Moved taskname prefixing to a central location, moved timestamping here
   also, added area/level prefixing, and tidied up this prefixing to make
   sure it looks good on all the possible debug devices.

 * Can now do any debuglib function to any debug device, including trace
   output, this hasn't been the case for a while.

 * Added new option, to set whether you want to prefix all debug lines
   with the area/level pair specified in dprintf, dfprintf etc.  Added
   new function to set this option.  debug_set_area_level_prefix ()

 * remotedb output now uses new "raw" output mode added to remotedb in
   version 0.06.  _DebugLib now requires remotedb version >= 0.06_

 * Added new test cases into CLI_App test harness, and changed a few things
   in TestMod.

 * Added Memcheck misc block registration into buffering code, which allows
   buffering to be used on the DebugLib Memcheck build.

 * Added lots of new function names into the always_ignore field which is
   used to tell trace which functions to ignore.  It seems that some the
   internet libraries have function names emebedded, which causes horrible
   loops when using DebugLib to output trace info to remotedb.  Also added
   debug_* and remote_debug_*

 * Added StrongHelp topics for ddumpbuf, debug_output_buffer_* and
   debug_set_area_level_prefix.  Updated the "Setting up the library"
   section.

 * Checked with all the debug devices except TML and serial.

1.4
log
@ * Initial work on tidying design of DebugLib.  Each output method is now
   more or less independant, and in its own file.  The common functions
   of each debug output method are accessed using an array of function
   pointers.  In the fullness of time this should make it easy to add new
   devices (and perhaps some cunning stuff with the linker).

 * Code re-org has been tested, and seen to work for at least one debug
   method.

@


1.3
log
@ * Overhauled how DebugLib options are handled.  Options are now held in
   an options structure internal to DebugLib.  Options are set one at a
   time by function calls, this makes it much easier to add new options
   over time.  debug_set_options and debug_output_device now deprecated,
   but still provided.  Updated StrongHelp manual to document this
   new behaviour.

 * Fixed trace output somewhat...should now look better on remotedb
   output (no extraneous CRs), and you can now set the trace device to
   be the same as the main debug device.  Setting trace device to "printf"
   now also works (file still to do, as you still can't "dfprintf" to file)

 * Added one of the new options function calls to the CLI_App test harness,
   to test functionality.

 * Improved the !MkCleans for the test harnesses.

log
@ * Renamed function "strdup" in c.misc to avoid conflicts when building
   with other code that define strdup

 * Added extra option to debug_set_options to allow timestamping of debug
   output...doesn't handle \n chars in debug output very elegantly, but
   it'll do for now.  Option is DebugLib_Options_StampDebug_(On/Off)

1.1
log
@ * Tidied debug_initialise function greatly.  It now uses a number of
   auxiliary functions to reduce the size and complexity of the function.
   The auxiliary functions use functions in the new file misc.c, most
   importantly a veneer to use OS_ReadVarVal nicely.

 * Storage of taskname, and filename for file output method is now done
   with dynamic memory allocation, used to be statically sized buffers.
