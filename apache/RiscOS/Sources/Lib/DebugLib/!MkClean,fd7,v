log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
One subtle difference here is there's no intermediate link step any more, since the ${DEBUGLIBS} already drags in all the required libraries. As a result, when linking with DebugLib the linker should be able to throw away unused sections, making your debug executable a bit smaller.
Tested with a debug build of USBDriver in PRINTF_OUTPUT mode.

log
@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

1.4
log
@* Added EraseCVS command to !MkClean.
* BLaughton spotted that DebugLib's object code was still being linked into
  apps when DEBUGLIB was not defined.  This is because the object code is of
  type AOF.  DebugLib must generate an AOF file to partially link in PDebug
  and Trace.  What happens now is that the generated AOF is now run through
  libfile to produce an ALF file.  Takes approx 31k off binary size when not
  compiled in.

log
@--------
  * Added buffering support.
Detail:
-------
  * DebugLib output can now be buffered and then output.  This is primarily
    for debugging ROM modules that would be active before the parallel
    port is alive during boot up.  Two new functions have been added to
    support this; debug_output_buffer_on() and debug_output_buffer_off().
    Updated documentation to follow.
Admin:
------
  * Tested on RiscPC/NC with Parallel, DebugIt and System variable
    override of output settings.
