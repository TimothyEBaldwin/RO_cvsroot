log
@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

1.2
log
@ * Added debug and MemCheck targets to DebugLib.  They don't get exported,
   as they are only for DebugLib development.  They were used to spot...

 * Found and fixed malloc block overwrite in the level checking code.  I
   was mallocing too small of a block by doing strlen on the wrong
   string.  This bug was causing problems when level filtering was used
   with apps compiled with DebugLib.

 * Tidied OS_ReadVarVal veneer.

 * Added MemCheck code and build target to CLI_App test program, which uses
   the new MemCheck target of DebugLib.
