1.2
log
@ * Continued tidy-up of DebugLib:

 * All DebugLib functions now namespaced, they all start debug_<filename>_
  (except the functions in debug.c which are debug_).

 * Device specific #defines etc moved into device specific header files,
   e.g. debugit.h

 * Moved taskname prefixing to a central location, moved timestamping here
   also, added area/level prefixing, and tidied up this prefixing to make
   sure it looks good on all the possible debug devices.

 * Can now do any debuglib function to any debug device, including trace
   output, this hasn't been the case for a while.

 * Added new option, to set whether you want to prefix all debug lines
   with the area/level pair specified in dprintf, dfprintf etc.  Added
   new function to set this option.  debug_set_area_level_prefix ()

 * remotedb output now uses new "raw" output mode added to remotedb in
   version 0.06.  _DebugLib now requires remotedb version >= 0.06_

 * Added new test cases into CLI_App test harness, and changed a few things
   in TestMod.

 * Added Memcheck misc block registration into buffering code, which allows
   buffering to be used on the DebugLib Memcheck build.

 * Added lots of new function names into the always_ignore field which is
   used to tell trace which functions to ignore.  It seems that some the
   internet libraries have function names emebedded, which causes horrible
   loops when using DebugLib to output trace info to remotedb.  Also added
   debug_* and remote_debug_*

 * Added StrongHelp topics for ddumpbuf, debug_output_buffer_* and
   debug_set_area_level_prefix.  Updated the "Setting up the library"
   section.

 * Checked with all the debug devices except TML and serial.
