log
@  Tidy-up
Detail:
  Stewart's checkin about LibVersion reminded me I'd done some tidying
  (including the LibVersion thing) and not checked it in.  So here it is.

  Tidied Makefile, added standard headers to all the c and h files,
  including the regulation copyright message.

  Changed options.c so that it fits the coding style of the rest of
  DebugLib (naughty Stewart).

  Improved "strdup" routine.

  Moved stripdepend call into Makefile.

Admin:
  Built and tested.

1.2
log
@ * Overhauled how DebugLib options are handled.  Options are now held in
   an options structure internal to DebugLib.  Options are set one at a
   time by function calls, this makes it much easier to add new options
   over time.  debug_set_options and debug_output_device now deprecated,
   but still provided.  Updated StrongHelp manual to document this
   new behaviour.

 * Fixed trace output somewhat...should now look better on remotedb
   output (no extraneous CRs), and you can now set the trace device to
   be the same as the main debug device.  Setting trace device to "printf"
   now also works (file still to do, as you still can't "dfprintf" to file)

 * Added one of the new options function calls to the CLI_App test harness,
   to test functionality.

 * Improved the !MkCleans for the test harnesses.
