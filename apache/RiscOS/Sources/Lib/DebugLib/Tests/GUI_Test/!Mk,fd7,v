1.2
log
@ * Fixed Makefile so that it doesn't use "newer" when copying files.  This
   meant that an export wouldn't overwrite newer libraries, when you'd
   expect it to.

 * Tidied test app Makefiles and build obey files.

 * Fixed GUI test app, wasn't declaring it's windows as autocreate and/or
   shared, which meant it missed events.  Removed all warnings also.

 * Now outputs the PDebug version information when a device is activiated.
