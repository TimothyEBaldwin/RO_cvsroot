log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
One subtle difference here is there's no intermediate link step any more, since the ${DEBUGLIBS} already drags in all the required libraries. As a result, when linking with DebugLib the linker should be able to throw away unused sections, making your debug executable a bit smaller.
Tested with a debug build of USBDriver in PRINTF_OUTPUT mode.
