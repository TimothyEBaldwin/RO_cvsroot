log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
One subtle difference here is there's no intermediate link step any more, since the ${DEBUGLIBS} already drags in all the required libraries. As a result, when linking with DebugLib the linker should be able to throw away unused sections, making your debug executable a bit smaller.
Tested with a debug build of USBDriver in PRINTF_OUTPUT mode.

1.1
log
@ * Added debug and MemCheck targets to DebugLib.  They don't get exported,
   as they are only for DebugLib development.  They were used to spot...

 * Found and fixed malloc block overwrite in the level checking code.  I
   was mallocing too small of a block by doing strlen on the wrong
   string.  This bug was causing problems when level filtering was used
   with apps compiled with DebugLib.

 * Tidied OS_ReadVarVal veneer.

 * Added MemCheck code and build target to CLI_App test program, which uses
   the new MemCheck target of DebugLib.
