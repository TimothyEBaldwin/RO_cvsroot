1.1
log
@  Unavoidable API chanGe to NRArrays. Debug test harness build option.
Detail:
  Function was taking an optional pointer to a routine that acted in the
  same way as 'malloc'. What it really needed was a routine that acted
  in the same way as 'realloc'. Meanwhile, the test harness can be built
  to run under DDT to pinpoint the location of a failure easily.
Admin:
  Test harness updated. Debug test harness build requires BuildSys 4.37.

Version 0.13. Tagged as 'PRISMLib-0_13'
