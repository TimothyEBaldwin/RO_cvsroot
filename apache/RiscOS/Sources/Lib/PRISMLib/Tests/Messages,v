log
@  New function.
Detail:
  New NRLists.c function to find an element in a linked list (slow - just
  a simple linear search).
Admin:
  Test harness updated; all tests pass.

1.1
log
@  New functions; bug fixes; test harness.
Detail:
  New functions added in "NRArrays.c|h". Some shared kinds of function
  pointers turned into standard types and put into "FuncTypes.h" - not
  all function pointers used throughout are there, only shared ones at
  the moment (this may change in future). New test harness showed up
  a few bugs, mostly trivial (e.g. incorrect generation of an error
  message resulting in "%0" appearing instead of a parameter).
Admin:
  Tested :-) - test harness runs to completion. See Tests/!ReadMe to
  find out which things the test harness does or does not test. The
  test harness requires BuildSys 4.35.
