1.4
log
@  Added CLI and some interrupt routines; Doxygen comments.
Detail:
  Added CLI support routines in CLI.[c|h]. Added ENABLE macros to
  Interrupts.h. Some recently modified header files include Doxygen
  comments now; a configuration file, "Doxyfile", is included to
  generate documentation from files which include it. By default
  this causes output to go to "Docs.Doxygen" - you will probably
  need to create the "Docs" directory by hand first.
Admin:
  Test harness not updated; ReadMe has been. The CLI routines are
  tested from use in other components, so are not explicitly tested
  in the local test harness.

@PRISMLib tests - notes
======================

The following things are tested:

  Clients
  Handles
  Locks
  Interrupts (.h, via. Locks; SVC mode only)
  FuncTypes  (.h, via. NRArrays; only some definitions, not all)
  NRArrays
  JobQueues

The following things are not tested explicitly, but implicitly
as the test harness itself relies on them:

  Errors
  Messages

The following things are not tested as they are imported from
other locations and were tested there. It is assumed, due to
time pressures, that the import process introduced no errors.

  CLI
  RLists
  Timers

The following things are not tested here as they have already
been in use in real code for some time and tested that way.

  Errors
  Messages
  RLists
  Timers
  NRLists (except new function prismlib_nrl_find, which is tested fully)
  Mechanism

The following things are untested due to time pressures:

  TLV
  PTLOptions (not fully functional at the time of writing anyway)

1.3
log
@  More re-entrancy, new job queue functions.
Detail:
  Errors.c is now fully re-entrant. New JobQueue.[c|h] functions, fully
  tested in the test harness, provide a fixed length queue of a fixed
  number of words per queue entry (specified at creation time). Done here
  rather than through a SWI API in e.g. PRISM as the addition function is
  inherently variable argument based, which does not translate well to
  SWIs (the alternative is to pass a pointer to a constructed queue entry
  which has to be copied in place - fiddly and less efficient). New
  function in Mechanism.h to send a PRISM service call, but this service
  call is looking like it'll be removed due to wider architecture
  revisions anyway - recommendation is to not call this new function as
  it will probably be removed soon.
Admin:
  Test harness updated to cover job queue functions.

log
@  New function.
Detail:
  New NRLists.c function to find an element in a linked list (slow - just
  a simple linear search).
Admin:
  Test harness updated; all tests pass.

1.1
log
@  New functions; bug fixes; test harness.
Detail:
  New functions added in "NRArrays.c|h". Some shared kinds of function
  pointers turned into standard types and put into "FuncTypes.h" - not
  all function pointers used throughout are there, only shared ones at
  the moment (this may change in future). New test harness showed up
  a few bugs, mostly trivial (e.g. incorrect generation of an error
  message resulting in "%0" appearing instead of a parameter).
Admin:
  Tested :-) - test harness runs to completion. See Tests/!ReadMe to
  find out which things the test harness does or does not test. The
  test harness requires BuildSys 4.35.
