1.3
log
@  Change to Messages API.
Detail:
  Function prismlib_open_messages() now only opens messages if it has not
  already done so. Meanwhile, prismlib_reopen_messages(), a new function,
  only opens messages if prismlib_open_messages() *has* already done so.
  The intention is to allow correct handling of Service_MessagesFileClosed,
  which might go off due to some other Messages file closing in another
  component (depending on the OS version) at a point where a PRISMLib
  client should not be trying to reopen its own messages.
Admin:
  Tested briefly in ScreenFX module, worked as expected.

Version 0.20. Tagged as 'PRISMLib-0_20'

1.2
log
@  Bugs fixed, 'restrict's added.
Detail:
  Errors.c routines looked for a specific case of hex digit in the "Exx"
  token for error messages. When lookup failed, it tried to return an
  independent token "TNF" for the "token not found" message; pointess -
  the OS error is returned directly now, and both upper and lower case
  hex digit versions of the error token name are tried before failing.
  In addition - a few 'restrict' qualifiers added in Messages.c/h.
Admin:
  Test harness still runs successfully.

1.1
log
@  Overhaul to improve library consistency and support new naming
  conventions.
Detail:
  Extensive set of changes to follow naming conventions covered in
  PRISM/Docs/Naming and introduce a better library structure with
  more consistent file naming (important for exported headers) as
  well as function names (important for ease of use).
Admin:
  Requires header export of PRISM 0.21 or later. Used in many other
  modules tested on an Iyonix as part of a wider set of changes.
