1.2
log
@  Macro modification.
Detail:
  Internally, PRISMLIB_RETERR used temporary variable 'e' to store the
  return value of a passed function call. If that passed call itself used
  'e' for something (e.g. an outer variable 'e' existed that was then
  referenced as a function parameter) the two would collide. Changed the
  macro to use "prismlib__error", which should be far less likely to
  collide with other code.
Admin:
  Existing code compiles without changes and works as before.

1.1
log
@  Overhaul to improve library consistency and support new naming
  conventions.
Detail:
  Extensive set of changes to follow naming conventions covered in
  PRISM/Docs/Naming and introduce a better library structure with
  more consistent file naming (important for exported headers) as
  well as function names (important for ease of use).
Admin:
  Requires header export of PRISM 0.21 or later. Used in many other
  modules tested on an Iyonix as part of a wider set of changes.
