1.2
log
@  Some stuff to support MPEGDriverG 1.16.
Detail:
  * Added a function to ensure consistent handling of definition or lack
    thereof of aspect ratio-related stream attributes.
  * Moved throwback switch from Makefile into !MkLibs to prevent throwback
    occurring during ROM/baseline builds. (Also, !MkLibs now works with
    latest BuildSys.)
Admin:
  New source file passes development testing.

1.1
log
@  Initial import of PRISMLib into CVS.

Detail:
  PRISMLib provides some commonly used 'C' functions for PRISM modules.
  It is a little limited by being statically linked to a physical module
  instance, where that physical module may support multiple logical
  PRISM components; without having its own concept of sessions, no code
  that carries state data related to a particular component can be
  included. Sessions may be added in future but at the moment I see them
  as an unnecessary run-time overhead and too complex given the light-
  weight approach the library tries to take.

Admin:
  Compiled. PRISM module modified to use the library, and also compiled.
  Ran it on Iyonix - *-commands worked as expected. No other testing, but
  the code is by and large copied out of existing well tested sources.
