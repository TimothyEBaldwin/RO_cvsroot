@  Build fix
Detail:
  A couple of object files to this library didn't build due to the absence
  of a header from a closed-source component. Fortunately, these object files
  are not required by ScreenFX (the only public module which relies on this
  library) so I've simply removed them from the library.
Admin:
  Tested in a disc build (now including ScreenFX).

1.13
log
@Updated Makefile in line with batch-one source release, ie reflecting the
fact that some source files are being held back from release.
Note that this means that at the time of writing, checking out older
revisions than this from the shared source repository will result in sources
that do not build. If the missing files are later reinstated, then it will
become possible to build old revisions again.

1.12
log
@  Added CLI and some interrupt routines; Doxygen comments.
Detail:
  Added CLI support routines in CLI.[c|h]. Added ENABLE macros to
  Interrupts.h. Some recently modified header files include Doxygen
  comments now; a configuration file, "Doxyfile", is included to
  generate documentation from files which include it. By default
  this causes output to go to "Docs.Doxygen" - you will probably
  need to create the "Docs" directory by hand first.
Admin:
  Test harness not updated; ReadMe has been. The CLI routines are
  tested from use in other components, so are not explicitly tested
  in the local test harness.

log
@  Some stuff to support MPEGDriverG 1.16.
Detail:
  * Added a function to ensure consistent handling of definition or lack
    thereof of aspect ratio-related stream attributes.
  * Moved throwback switch from Makefile into !MkLibs to prevent throwback
    occurring during ROM/baseline builds. (Also, !MkLibs now works with
    latest BuildSys.)
Admin:
  New source file passes development testing.

1.10
log
@  More re-entrancy, new job queue functions.
Detail:
  Errors.c is now fully re-entrant. New JobQueue.[c|h] functions, fully
  tested in the test harness, provide a fixed length queue of a fixed
  number of words per queue entry (specified at creation time). Done here
  rather than through a SWI API in e.g. PRISM as the addition function is
  inherently variable argument based, which does not translate well to
  SWIs (the alternative is to pass a pointer to a constructed queue entry
  which has to be copied in place - fiddly and less efficient). New
  function in Mechanism.h to send a PRISM service call, but this service
  call is looking like it'll be removed due to wider architecture
  revisions anyway - recommendation is to not call this new function as
  it will probably be removed soon.
Admin:
  Test harness updated to cover job queue functions.

1.9
log
@  New functions; bug fixes; test harness.
Detail:
  New functions added in "NRArrays.c|h". Some shared kinds of function
  pointers turned into standard types and put into "FuncTypes.h" - not
  all function pointers used throughout are there, only shared ones at
  the moment (this may change in future). New test harness showed up
  a few bugs, mostly trivial (e.g. incorrect generation of an error
  message resulting in "%0" appearing instead of a parameter).
Admin:
  Tested :-) - test harness runs to completion. See Tests/!ReadMe to
  find out which things the test harness does or does not test. The
  test harness requires BuildSys 4.35.

1.6
log
@  Clarification, correction, and new functions.
Detail:
  Clarification in NRLists.c to indicate that items are zero-initialised
  on creation. Fix to Interrupts.h which was including <kernel.h> when it
  really wanted <swis.h> (which itself includes kernel.h). New functions:
  Lock.c|h implement a (very) mundane lock system which can be used to
  defend against re-entrancy. These may well be added to with more
  sophisticated facilities over time, or removed entirely if the current
  thinking on why they are needed changes.
Admin:
  Compiles, used by PFCBuffer sources, but no run-time testing yet.

1.5
log
@  New header file; 'restrict' added in NRLists.
Detail:
  NRLists.c|h can't use 'restrict' too much as it does create aliases to
  quite a few of the function parameters, but here and there it applies,
  so added it. New header file is "Interrupts.h", containing four simple
  macros to turn interrupts on and off. Makes use of Norcroft optimisation
  hack "__swi" as in RLists.c, which I don't like, but does result in code
  that's about as simple as it can be.
Admin:
  Compiled through test use in PFCBuffer's in-prorgress Session.c; DecAOF
  output from the resulting object file looks about right, but no run-time
  testing.

log
@  Overhaul to improve library consistency and support new naming
  conventions.
Detail:
  Extensive set of changes to follow naming conventions covered in
  PRISM/Docs/Naming and introduce a better library structure with
  more consistent file naming (important for exported headers) as
  well as function names (important for ease of use).
Admin:
  Requires header export of PRISM 0.21 or later. Used in many other
  modules tested on an Iyonix as part of a wider set of changes.

1.3
log
@  Compilation fixes, bug fixes, new features.

Detail:
  Added prismlib_make_message() and PRISMLIB_RETERR.

  Added -Wpe in Makefile to suppress warnings about non-standard includes,
  then standardised on using <name> for any exported inclusions and
  "name" for any local inclusions.

  Removed 'restrict' keyword on function pointers as CC 559 raises this
  as an error.

  Fixed heinous bug in Mechanism.c that prevents any client from properly
  registering (and therefore properly deregistering) with PRISM.

  Corrected reason code name using underscores to one that didn't as per
  latest definitions in PRISM.h for version 0.18 of the PRISM module.

Admin:
  Tested using in-development PFC Buffer module; new functions and bug fix
  perform correctly, other sundry fixes result in source that builds.

1.2
log
@  Some updates to PRISMLib - partly to allow Andrew to make sweeping changes
  to the whole PRISM codebase, partly as a safety measure prior to office move.
Detail:
  * Adapted Makefile to use shared Makefiles.
  * Added re-entrant linked list code from MPEGDriverG (originally written
    for PFCClock).
  * Added a TLV handling library, based on prototype PFCPresent.
  * Started work on generic PTL module Options handling code - still a
    work in progress, not built into library yet.
Admin:
  Not used in anger yet.

1.1
log
@  Initial import of PRISMLib into CVS.

Detail:
  PRISMLib provides some commonly used 'C' functions for PRISM modules.
  It is a little limited by being statically linked to a physical module
  instance, where that physical module may support multiple logical
  PRISM components; without having its own concept of sessions, no code
  that carries state data related to a particular component can be
  included. Sessions may be added in future but at the moment I see them
  as an unnecessary run-time overhead and too complex given the light-
  weight approach the library tries to take.

Admin:
  Compiled. PRISM module modified to use the library, and also compiled.
  Ran it on Iyonix - *-commands worked as expected. No other testing, but
  the code is by and large copied out of existing well tested sources.
