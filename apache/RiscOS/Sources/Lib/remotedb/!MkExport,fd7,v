1.3
log
@ * Improved namespacing of functions throughout remotedb.  External
   functions weren't able to be renamed, so as not to break compatability
   with programs that use remotedb

 * Added a new API call "remote_debug_print_line".  It is similar to
   "debug_print_line", except that it takes flags, and you can pass the
   length of the line you want to output (so you can pass non-NULL
   terminated strings).  The one used bit in the flag is bit 1, which if
   set means that the debug output should be "raw", i.e. bypass the
   priority code, and not force a \n at the end of the line.  The next
   DebugLib version (0.38) will use this raw mode.

 * Renamed the remotedb_version function to remote_debug_version to better
   fit the namespacing of the rest of the (correctly namespaced) API calls.
   Compatability shouldn't be too much of a concern, because it's a new
   API call, which very few people will be using.

 * Added -throwback into !Mk and !MkExport

 * Changed C flags to -ffah, to stop function name embedding...this was
   causing problems with using DebugLib Trace output with remotedb.
