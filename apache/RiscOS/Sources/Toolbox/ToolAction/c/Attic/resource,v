4.2
log
@Makefile recreated to use TboxMake
Some component reorganisation to make it fit the pattern of the other Toolbox modules.
string32.c - use the (identical) copy in Toolbox/Common/string32.
resource.c - swap to corresponding functions in Toolbox/Common/objmodule.
msgs.c - swap to corresponding functions in Toolbox/Common/messages.

Additional changes
main.c:
 Always assume CMHG 5.16 or later is in use.
 Don't bother calling TinySupport_Share and TinySupport_Die, they just inc/decrement a counter.
toolaction.c:
 Use common debug functionality, refactor single (not very exciting) debug call.
utils.c:
 Excess header includes removed.

In fact, this module only uses header from OSLib, it doesn't link with it (instead using a handful of _swix macros in "tbem.h"). These could in future be changed to just use the tboxlibint functions with a (lot of) careful checking.

4.1
log
@  Unnecessary assembler rewritten in C.
  ROM build stub functions removed.
  32-bit build capability added.
Detail:
  A lot of simple calls were being made in assembler for no reason.
    These are now done in C except for the veneer to call ResourceFS
    directly.  This veneer's exit code auto-detects which APCS to use.
  ResourceFS management functions are no longer in the image as they
    are no longer called.  They used to be stub functions that returned
    no error.
  Message file is linked in using a resgen-generated AOF file instead of
    being BIN'ed in the assembler.
  ROM builds contain no reference to ResourceFS at all, and do not trap
    the ResourceFS service call.
Admin:
  RAM build testing on desktop machine.
  Full 32-bit compatibility requires a 32bit capable defmod otherwise the
    OSLib-style library file it exports uses the wrong APCS.
