4.1
log
@Makefile recreated to use TboxMake
Some component reorganisation to make it fit the pattern of the other Toolbox modules.
string32.c - use the (identical) copy in Toolbox/Common/string32.
resource.c - swap to corresponding functions in Toolbox/Common/objmodule.
msgs.c - swap to corresponding functions in Toolbox/Common/messages.

Additional changes
main.c:
 Always assume CMHG 5.16 or later is in use.
 Don't bother calling TinySupport_Share and TinySupport_Die, they just inc/decrement a counter.
toolaction.c:
 Use common debug functionality, refactor single (not very exciting) debug call.
utils.c:
 Excess header includes removed.

In fact, this module only uses header from OSLib, it doesn't link with it (instead using a handful of _swix macros in "tbem.h"). These could in future be changed to just use the tboxlibint functions with a (lot of) careful checking.
