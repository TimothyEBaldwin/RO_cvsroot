4.3
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Include paths changed to Unix style.
Debug and non debug CMHG definitions replaced by one which is selected by passing predefines to CMHG.
Removed dummy services.h.
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.
Reject out of range SWIs (fixes ticket #305).
Move structure document into Docs directory.
Get module base from AsmUtils.

log
@Changes to ensure that only the requested amount of parameters are
passed to/from the stack - previously 256 bytes was assumed but this
runs off the end of the stack frequently and hence caused problems
in systems where there is nothing mapped in after the end of the
stack.
