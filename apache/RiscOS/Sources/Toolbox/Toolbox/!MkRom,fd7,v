log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Include paths changed to Unix style.
Debug and non debug CMHG definitions replaced by one which is selected by passing predefines to CMHG.
Removed dummy services.h.
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.
Reject out of range SWIs (fixes ticket #305).
Move structure document into Docs directory.
Get module base from AsmUtils.

4.4
log
@  Modified Toolbox_Initialise SWI slightly.
Detail:
  You can now pass a path from which to locate your resources to the
  Toolbox_Initialise SWI, as well as simply a directory. This does not
  affect backwards-compatibility and means that newer software can use
  this rather than the "MyPath:a.^" pathname trick.

  Also fixed the !Mk* TaskObey files so that they actually work.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC with existing Toolbox applications (i.e. Phoenix and
  others) and new ones using paths to specify the location of their
  resources.

log
@  Changed to use common Makefile system.
  Debug build facility added.
Detail:
  Uses core facilities from Common instead of having private copies.
  Makefile vastly simplified to simply define a few macros, then include
    the common Toolbox Makefile which is exported by Common.
Admin:
  Requires Common 0.09 or later (RiscOS/Sources/Toolbox/Common; Common-0_09)
  Requires BuildSys 1.92 or later (RiscOS/BuildSys; BuildSys-1_92)
  Requires Library 0.41 or later (RiscOS/Library; Library-0_41)
