4.2
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Include paths changed to Unix style.
Debug and non debug CMHG definitions replaced by one which is selected by passing predefines to CMHG.
Removed dummy services.h.
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.
Reject out of range SWIs (fixes ticket #305).
Dependencies cleaned from tests.

log
@  Changed to use common Makefile system.
  Debug build facility added.
Detail:
  Uses core facilities from Common instead of having private copies.
  Makefile vastly simplified to simply define a few macros, then include
    the common Toolbox Makefile which is exported by Common.
Admin:
  Requires Common 0.09 or later (RiscOS/Sources/Toolbox/Common; Common-0_09)
  Requires BuildSys 1.92 or later (RiscOS/BuildSys; BuildSys-1_92)
  Requires Library 0.41 or later (RiscOS/Library; Library-0_41)
