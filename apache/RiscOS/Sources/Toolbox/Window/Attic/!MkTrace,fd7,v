4.4
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Include paths changed to Unix style.
Debug and non debug CMHG definitions replaced by one which is selected by passing predefines to CMHG.
Removed dummy services.h.
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.
Reject out of range SWIs (fixes ticket #305).
Dependencies cleaned from tests.
