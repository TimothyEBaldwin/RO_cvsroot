1.2
log
@Resolve double inclusion warning in the makefile.
Internationalise the "Unable to dynamically link" message from the assembler code.
Move error numbers into their allocated range, was previously using its SWI chunk instead!
Removed the Generic_SWI_handler veneer to TS_SWI_handler, it's not been needed for over 13 years according to CVS.
Reorder a push to avoid deprecated instruction warning.
Lined up code to column 17.
Commented the service call a bit.
Used only the specific range needed in OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas for speed.

Version 0.15. Tagged as 'TinyStubs-0_15'
