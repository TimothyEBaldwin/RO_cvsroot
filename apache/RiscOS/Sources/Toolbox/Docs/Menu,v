adds show-centre support for menu items

Bug fix: ShowAtPointer for objects shown from Menu objects now implemented

Zero-length menu entries caused the Wimp to display oflaoflaofla etc. on
RISC OS 3.7 and Ursula due to a bad NULL pointer usage in c.auxiliary.
This is now fixed so that an empty menu item is displayed.
