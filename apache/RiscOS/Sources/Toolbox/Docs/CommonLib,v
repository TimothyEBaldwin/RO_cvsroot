Tided up the make process for the libraries tboxlib and debuglib (debuglib
was in with the same set of sources as tboxlib to I build it anyway).

All header files in the objects directory now get exported to
<Lib$Dir>.tboxlibs.h during export_hdrs phase. tboxlib and debuglib get build
with both zM and none zM flags and exported to <Lib$Dir>.tboxlibs.o.

Changed the sources slightly so they don't refer to the internal copy of the
header files found in objects but the copy previously exported to the right
place.

New zap_gadget_string macro to assist in zapping string into templates.
In addition to the offset into the gadget structure of the pointer to
the string data, this macro takes the offset of the maximum length field
in the same template and ensures that the buffer length stated is at least
long enough to hold the string being zapped into the buffer.  This

ProgInfo template updated, new methods added for URI/event handling.

log
@Import of some brief notes on changes to the toolbox modules for a release
done on July 9th 1998.  They will be on the release CD (for whatever the
release was), but it might be useful to have them stored here for posterity.
