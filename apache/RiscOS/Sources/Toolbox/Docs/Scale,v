Date declaration added to CMHG header files to ensure date is fixed.

Uses new zap_gadget_string macro to ensure that it increases the buffer
size for the actionbutton gadgets if necessary.  Fix for PAN-01591.  Setting
a large percentage value for one of the preset buttons in a Scale object does
not cause random crashes/machine freezes
