1.1.2.1
log
@Made a single, unified Makefile.  myswis.h renamed to ModHdr.h so that it can be
automatically generated by CMHG.  Changed DAYTONA_BUILD flag to Daytona_BUILD so
that it can be automatically defined in the Makefile using the build
environment's System variable (called ${SYSTEM} in Makefiles).

@Manually merge in v0.06 bugfixes from Spinner branch, add CLR
functionality and tilde support, reinstate region select, and explicitly
disallow Ctrl-I (tab support is not functional in TextGadget anyway).
