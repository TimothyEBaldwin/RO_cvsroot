@Makefile recreated from fragments
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.

1.4
log
@Changed to use shared TboxMake makefile.
Removed local duplication of string32 and rmensure, since the common library has these in.
Rename TextGadget.c to main.c to fall into line with the "o.mainROM" rule.
Compiles, but not tested.

1.3
log
@  32-bit compatibility.
  Improved some of the rather odd Piers-assembler.
Detail:
  Some rather odd assembler has been tidied up.
  Removed some obsolete header files that are no longer required.
  Removed "objs" - nothing uses it - looks like an accidental
    checkin.
Admin:
  Tested on Risc PC with Phoebe & 32 machine builds.

log
@* Event generation for ScrollList fixed - you no longer get spurious events
  for a phantom extra item on the list.
* Flag added to ScrollList_Selection event to indicate adjust click.
* Fixed un-initialised base_line variable causing text of ScrollList
  items to disappear when the desktop font was the System font.

1.1.2.1
log
@Made a single, unified Makefile.  myswis.h renamed to ModHdr.h so that it can be
automatically generated by CMHG.  Changed DAYTONA_BUILD flag to Daytona_BUILD so
that it can be automatically defined in the Makefile using the build
environment's System variable (called ${SYSTEM} in Makefiles).

@Manually merge in v0.06 bugfixes from Spinner branch, add CLR
functionality and tilde support, reinstate region select, and explicitly
disallow Ctrl-I (tab support is not functional in TextGadget anyway).
