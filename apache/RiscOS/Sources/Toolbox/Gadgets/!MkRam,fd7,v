@Plot a more credible rendition of TextArea and ScrollList
Both the TextArea gadget and ScrollList were outputting an unhelpful white rectangle and mysterious black rectangle when asked to plot the gadget prototype (eg. in the gadget palette in ResEd). The black rectangle turned out to represent a scroll bar, though it was the wrong width.
Changed to plot a 2D scrollbar (ala RISC OS 2) then overlay a virtual icon with the name of the gadget type.
main.c:
Relocate helper functions into glib.
Return 'Bad SWI' for unknown subreasons.
glib.c/glib3.c:
Remove various unused functions.
Added new function to plot a grey scrollbar from nested rectangles.
TextArea.c:
Add a vertical, or horixontal, or both, scrollbar plus the label "TextArea".
ScrollList.c:
Add a vertical scrollbar plus the label "ScrollList".

Requires Common-0_25 for the colour defines. Tested in !ResEd in various eigenfactor modes.

@Makefile recreated from fragments
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.

@Change to link against tboxlibint
For some reason this toolbox module was unique in linking against the public toolboxlib rather than the internal one, this meant having to carefully tippy toe around not mixing header files (as they contain similar but differently named definitions).
A massive search and replace job.
Tested briefly using ResEd/ResTest and a textarea and scrolllist in a ROM build.
Requires Common-0_21.

log
@Changed to use shared TboxMake makefile.
Removed local duplication of string32 and rmensure, since the common library has these in.
Rename TextGadget.c to main.c to fall into line with the "o.mainROM" rule.
Compiles, but not tested.

@ * Added 2 new TextArea calls, as they were defined in docs.TextArea.
   TextArea_SetCursorPosition and TextArea_GetCursorPosition.

 * Removed a lot of unneeded comments that wrapped around changes I made
   a while ago.

 * !MkRam now enables throwback.

1.1.2.1
log
@* Event generation for ScrollList fixed - you no longer get spurious events
  for a phantom extra item on the list.
* Flag added to ScrollList_Selection event to indicate adjust click.
* Fixed un-initialised base_line variable causing text of ScrollList
  items to disappear when the desktop font was the System font.
