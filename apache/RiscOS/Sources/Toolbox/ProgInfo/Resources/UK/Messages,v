log
@Added TARGET to Makefile so those !Mk things work.
Correct spelling of License.
Added {Default} to messages file so the licence strings don't get
tokenised - this caused a bug where the buffer_size was read but because
the string wasn't being expanded the last letter of the licence type
was omitted.Of course RAM modules work OK as they're not tokenised.

Version 0.18. Tagged as 'ProgInfo-0_18'
