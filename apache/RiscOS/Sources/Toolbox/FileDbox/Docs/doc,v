          16             Initial filename filter (shows all files if
                                                  none)
                       
          20             Root directory
          
          24             Initial Directory
          

All names, etc. are strings references.  None is specified when the box is
not ticked...

The root directory and directory stuff determines what's the top
level the user is allowed to go upto.  Directories above root are
not displayed in the path list box.  Sounds complex and messy
I know but it was put in because of security issues.  It also
means all the rubbish such as adfs::...$. can be hidden.  Some
examples :

      Root directory    : adfs::4.$
      Initial directory : work.rubbish
      
Initial directory is relative to root directory. i.e. directory shown in
box is adfs::4.$.work.rubbish.  However, path list shows only work and rubbish,
hiding all the adfs:: stuff.

Another example.

      Root directory    : nfs::valhalla.$.blah.blah.users
      Initial directory : rob.documents.letters
      
Means that the user can't go to directories above his own directory
as the path list only shows rob, documents and letters.

Don't have to do this.  Can ignore root directory and just put absolute
one in initial directory.  All path elements will be shown...

Hope this explains things OK.  If not give me a shout.  I've included
a few example res files as well.  Drag onto ResTest and do create to
create it, and then show to show it.

Rob.
