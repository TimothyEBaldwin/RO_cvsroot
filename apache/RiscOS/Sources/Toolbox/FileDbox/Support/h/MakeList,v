/*
On entry:
	object		The FileDbox.
	component	The ScrollList gadget within the FileDbox.
	directory	The directory whose files and directories are to be put into the scrolllist gadget.
	match		Wild-carded string for matching leafnames. Only files matching this will be added to the scrolllist.
	sorts		An array of sorting methods, terminated with a AcornNC_dirscan_sort_NONE.
			The sorting is equivalent to sorting first by the last item in the array, then by the second-to-last,
			and so on. Thus the main sorting method is sorts[0], with sorts[1], sorts[2]... used for directory
			items that are otherwise indistinguishable.
	spritesize	One of AcornNC_dirscan_spritesize_NONE, AcornNC_dirscan_spritesize_LARGE, 
			AcornNC_dirscan_spritesize_SMALL.
On exit:
	
This clears the ScrollList gadget 'component' and then adds all
files/directories in 'directory' matching 'match' to the ScrollList
gadget 'component'. The files/directories are sorted in the order
specified by 'sorts'.
