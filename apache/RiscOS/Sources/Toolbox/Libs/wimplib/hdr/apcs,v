log
@  32-bit build capability added.
Detail:
  Assembler veneers pull in macros to perform subroutine returns which
    controls whether flags are restored or not.
Admin:
  Output compared to previous version to establish no change for APCS-R
    builds.  APCS-32 output inspected manually to verify correctness.

Version 0.09. Tagged as 'Libs-0_09'
