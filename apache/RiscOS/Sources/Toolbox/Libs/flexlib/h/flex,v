@  Add return parameter to flex_init.
Detail:
  Area number returned if dynamic areas are used. Required by Browse.
Admin:
  A long standing modification that has been waiting to go into CVS for
  a long time. Tested on Iyonix,  prototype Batch Two build environment.

 * Description:   Allocates n bytes of store, obtained from the Wimp.
 *
 * Parameters:    flex_ptr anchor -- to be used to access allocated store
 *                int n -- number of bytes to be allocated
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    You should pass the & of a pointer variable as the first
 *                parameter. The allocated store MUST then be accessed
 *                indirectly, through this, ie. (*anchor)[0] ..(*anchor)[n]
 *                This is important since  the allocated store may later be
 *                moved (it's a shifting heap!!). If there's not enough
 *                store returns zero leaving anchor unchanged.

 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success.

 *                int by -- extent
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    If by is +ve, then store is extended, and locations above
 *                "at" are copied up by "by".
 *                If by is -ve, then store is reduced, and any bytes beyond

 *                flex_ptr from -- current location of anchor
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    The pointer pointed to by "to" is set to point to the
 *                flex block pointed to by "from", and "to" becomes the
 *                new anchor. The block should then only be accessed via

/* ---------------------------- flex_set_budge ----------------------------
 * Description:    Set whether to move the flex store when the C runtime
 *                 needs to extend the heap
 *
 * Parameters:     int newstate -- whether to budge
 * Returns:        previous state
 * Other Info:     If 0 is passed, if the C library needs to extend the
 *                 heap, flex will refuse to move. This means that you can
 *                 rely on pointers into flex blocks across function calls.
 *                 This is the DEFAULT state after flex_init().
 *                 If 1 is passed, this will cause flex store to be moved
 *                 up if the C library needs to extend the heap.  Note that
 *                 in this state, you can only rely on pointers into flex
 *                 blocks across function calls which do not extend the
 *                 stack and do not call malloc.
 *                 If -1 is passed, no change is made.
 *                 Whatever parameter is passed, flex_set_budge will return
 *                 the previous state, suitable for another call to
 *                 flex_setbudge.
 *
 *                 On a machine with dynamic areas, this function is
 *                 useless and harmless.
