@Fixed so that it builds and installs. No runtime checking.

1.5
log
@  Removed conflicting VersionNum file from eventlib directory.
  Version number exported.
Detail:
  The tag validity checks are being defeated by the VersionNum file
    in the eventlib directory.  This is now removed, and the assembler
    fragment pulls in (the new) VersionASM from the parent directory.
  Top-level makefile now exports a LibVersion file.
  !MkClean scripts removed dynamic dependencies from Makefiles.
  Dynamic dependencies removed from existing Makefiles.
Admin:
  Built.

@Build process improvements :
* Standardised make process in common will all other modules in build.
* Internal and external toolbox libraries and headers exported to
  <Lib$Dir>.tboxlibint and <Lib$Dir>.tboxlibs respectivly.
* Resources now localised.
* Local !MkClean and !MkRom now use amu_machine.

1.1.2.1
log
@Added makefile to ..Toolbox.Libs directory, which deals with exporting
the library headers and ALF files into '<Lib$Dir>.tboxlibs' in the
export part of the build process.

Note that there are no sources for the toolbox C libraries in the build
tree, so this makefile doesn't compile anything yet.
