log
@  Don't rely on Makatic3 or Every2.
Detail:
  Toolbox core library toolboxlib used Dr Smith's Toolkit components to
  build. This is not releasable as part of the shared source initiative.
  Statically defined equivalents have been provided instead, with notes
  describing how to go back to the toolkit's dynamic equivalents.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix under prototype Batch Two build environment.

| This was prefix.  PREFIX DOES NOT WORK IN THE BUILD.  ALWAYS USE DIR INSTEAD.
Dir <Obey$Dir>

| If you have Makatic, you should auto-generate the library
| Makefile and launch it with something like this:
|
|   Makatic.Makatic3 -e -o <Obey$Dir>.AutoGenMF -d <Obey$Dir> -t <Obey$Dir>.TemplateMF -m "CCExtra=-zps1" -a
|
| If you enable the Makatic line above, don't forget to
| comment out the amu_machine line below.
|
| Since Makatic cannot be included in the standard shared
| source distribution, a previously generated AutoGenMF is
| included herein, which needs to be manually maintained
| if you don't have the means to regenerate it otherwise.

@Prefix removed from obey file.  PREFIX DOES NOT WORK IN THE BUILD.  Updated
auto generated makefile.  (Perhaps it needs deleting.)

log
@Build process improvements :
* Standardised make process in common will all other modules in build.
* Internal and external toolbox libraries and headers exported to
  <Lib$Dir>.tboxlibint and <Lib$Dir>.tboxlibs respectivly.
* Resources now localised.
* Local !MkClean and !MkRom now use amu_machine.
