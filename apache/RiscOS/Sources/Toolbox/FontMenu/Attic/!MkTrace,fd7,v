4.4
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Include paths changed to Unix style.
Debug and non debug CMHG definitions replaced by one which is selected by passing predefines to CMHG.
Removed dummy services.h.
Don't bother calling TinyStubs SWI since in ROM it does nothing, and the RAM versions haven't used it since ~1997.
Use module header constants generated from CMHG rather than hand made one.
Reject out of range SWIs (fixes ticket #305).

log
@No longer attempts to produce HasBeenHidden events by looking for MenuWarning
messages - this doesn't work with Toolbox 1.42 or later. Will now only produce
HasBeenHidden events before another FontMenu is shown or when the menu tree
is deleted.

Fixes crashes caused when a FontMenu 0.18-0.23 were used with Toolbox 1.42-.
