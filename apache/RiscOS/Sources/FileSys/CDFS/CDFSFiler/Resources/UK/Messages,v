@Add missing ellipsis
Detail:
  Player leads to a persistent dialogue box, so requires an ellipsis per Style Guide page 38.
Admin:
  Spotted during review of User Guide "Other storage devices and filing systems".

@Cranked up the userdata area to 1k as it's used to load templates into
temporarily and was previously only 256 so since the templates file has
long since exceeded this the local stack got trampled on.
Deleted a ^ somewhere.
Added audio CD player app in place of the volume control.
Volume window (now player) now opens at the same height above the iconbar
as display manager opens its dialogue.
Added eject menu to iconbar menu (greyed out if the drive is locked).
Made the configuration submenu an assembly time option (off) since it's
been in configure for ages.
Dismounting a CD will now restore the iconbar icon to the default icon.
Added a free menu entry (requires CDFS which supports this).
Forced "dragging" flag to zero at startup.
Things to do:
 when choosing player from the menu pass round a message and see if
 anyone else wants to be the player,if that bounces look for the
 existance of a system variable run it and try again,if that bounces then
 use the built in player?
 check the details box gets updated correctly when toggling between two
 drives one of which is playing the other not

@  Changes for RISC OS 5.
Detail:
  * Merged in RISCOS Ltd's changes - just an Ursula service call table, and
    added fast reject code, which was missing for some reason
  * Moved resources here from CDFSResources. Allows tokenisation to happen.
    Also taken the opportunity to remove the separate sprite files in
    Resources:$.Resources.CDFSFiler, since they've been in the Wimp ROM sprites
    for ages; CDFSFiler will now ignore them even if they are present
  * Uses objasm and shared makefiles
  * 32-bit compatible
Admin:
  Not tested.
