@Various CDFS enhancements
* Increase BGET/BPUT buffer declared to FileSwitch to 2k to match the natural sector size (FileSwitch has been able to support this since version 2.28)
* Remove local debug macros, use those from NDRDebug instead
* Change to use SETV/CLRV macros now the ones in HdrSrc are 26/32 neutral
* Clarify those situations where LBA mode is being selected by using symbol 'LBAFormat'
* Extend *WHICHDISC to allow an optional drive number to be provided (the code has existed for years, but the GSTrans flags and help denied its use)

@CDDriver error numbers taken from header file.
Note: CDFS' error block is actually offset within CDDriver's (by 64).
The report for *CDDevices now lines up properly with disc sizes < 100MB.
The syntax error for *PlayMSF no longer uses MessageTrans_GSLookup which tried to substitute the <> arguments.
Non internationalised module now has syntax error messages too.

@Line up sources to normal columns.
Around 25000 spaces required, but rather easier to read as a result - it has revealed some bugs (not addressed in this commit).
Not quite binary identical, because an 'addr' of the ambiguous disc name error has moved by 1 byte due to a missing ALIGN directive.

@  A few fixes.
Detail:
  * Fixed a couple of top-bit-set pointer problems
  * Fixed a couple of places where it was assumed that SWIs preserved flags
  * Uses kernel internationalisation for command help, so full tokenisation
    now works properly
  * Added NdrDebug support

log
@  Lots of changes for RISC OS 5.
Detail:
  * Updated to use objasm, shared makefiles and global headers
  * Ripped out lots of RISC OS 2 support code so we can see the wood for the
    trees now
  * 32-bit compatible (a bit of a slog)
  * Now has its own resources phase, replacing the use of the CDFSResources
    module. Also means that messages can now be tokenised properly. For
    good measure, split out CmdHelp tokens into separate file
  * Hopefully fixed more bugs along the way than I introduced. I've seen
    lots of nasty stack imbalances in error cases, but not fixed all of
    them, I'm afraid
Admin:
  Tested briefly on a Risc PC; not enough support modules to run on Tungsten
