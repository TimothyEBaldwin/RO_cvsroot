4.2
log
@This is a manual merge of CDFS 2.35 from RiscOS/UnU/OS_Core/CDFS/CDFS234
treating nturton_CDFS-2_29 as the branch point.
@
text
@This version of CDFS has reached version 2.29. We cannot advance this
version number to 2.30 and beyond because EESOX have released versions of
CDFS with version numbers greater than this. We should not overlap these
version numbers as this could lead to confusion in the field.

This version also does not suppport Green Book or White Book CD-ROMs. When
Black was being created our version of CDFS and the EESOX version which
supported Green Book and White Book were merged to create CDFS version 2.34.
Due to lack of test time it was decided not to use version 2.34 and to
regress back to version 2.28. The sources for version 2.34 were not deleted
and reside in the same parent directory as these sources but in directory
CDFS234. The sources are not visible via the source filer but should be
reinstated as the current sources (by renaming the CDFS234 directory as
CDFS) at the earliest opportunity.
