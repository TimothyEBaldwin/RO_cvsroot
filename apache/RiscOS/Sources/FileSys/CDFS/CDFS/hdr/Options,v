@Add support for Joliet format CD-ROMs
hdr/Hashes
s/Directory
s/EntryFile
s/FileMan
s/Filer
s/Free
 - mass search and replace of lots of poorly named definitions, removing unused ones, creating implicit ones
hdr/MyMacros
 - shuffle some registers in ConvertToArchyDate to save one temporary so it can be used for something else
 - moved ReplaceBadCharacters here
hdr/Options
 - extra debug option
s/DiscOp
 - add Joliet, rename buffer indicies per hdr/Hashes
 - the fallback filetype assignment (when neither the ARCHIMEDES system extension nor MimeMap can help) can now be overridden by setting CDFS$DefaultType (which defaults to &FFD)
s/SWI
 - remove DAT<->MPEG mapping from the internal mapping table
s/Variables
 - trim out unused SWI_buffer reservation

Tested with valid ISO/Joliet/RockRidge supported combinations, documented in Docs/Combos, and accompanying test ISO images now stored there.
Tested with CD-I format disc 'Jigsaw' from Britannica.
Tested with High Sierra format disc 'Kings Quest V'.
Tested with photo CD sampler from Kodak.

log
@Various CDFS enhancements
* Increase BGET/BPUT buffer declared to FileSwitch to 2k to match the natural sector size (FileSwitch has been able to support this since version 2.28)
* Remove local debug macros, use those from NDRDebug instead
* Change to use SETV/CLRV macros now the ones in HdrSrc are 26/32 neutral
* Clarify those situations where LBA mode is being selected by using symbol 'LBAFormat'
* Extend *WHICHDISC to allow an optional drive number to be provided (the code has existed for years, but the GSTrans flags and help denied its use)

@Fix a few bugs
When lining up the code in 2.52, a few bugs became apparent (now the source was readable).
* In a handful of places it was assumed SWIs preserved flags, these have been reordered or branched around.
* The probe of UtilityModule 2.12 has been set to 3.00 and the logic now considers >= 3.00 rather than subtracting 1 from it to deduce the default filename truncation value.
* Removed support for supplemental filetype table in CDFSNewFileTypePath$File as this has been superceded by the MimeMap module (which CDFS uses). This mirrors the behaviour of DOSFS and LanManFS which consult the MimeMap first then (small) internal table second.
* Fix stack imbalance when reading the current setting with CDFS_Truncation leading to an abort

Other changes
* When the MimeMap module is absent ".doc" is taken to be a MS Word document.
* Changed the manual loads from :INDEX: of R12 to be ADR's or ADRL's so there's less literal pool thrashing.
* Three Push/Pull sequences to restore registers swapped for LDMIA's (in Directory.s).
* Reason codes to OS_ SWIs swapped for header file names.

log
@CDDriver error numbers taken from header file.
Note: CDFS' error block is actually offset within CDDriver's (by 64).
The report for *CDDevices now lines up properly with disc sizes < 100MB.
The syntax error for *PlayMSF no longer uses MessageTrans_GSLookup which tried to substitute the <> arguments.
Non internationalised module now has syntax error messages too.

@Exchange local definitions for central ones.
Hdr:HighFSI LowFSI Services CDROM CMOS UpCall and CDFS now used in preference to local definitions.
Macro 'Command' used to build the keyword table.

@Resolve the 32 assembler warnings
Mostly by swapping STASH/GRAB for Push/Pull macros.
Inlined the module header rather than defining it in a header file.
Renamed "Debug" macro to "DebugInline" to avoid clash with similarly named macro.

@  Nice new features.
Detail:
  * Reenabled BootFromCD option, and finished it off (so FSFunc_ReadBoot
    returns 2 (Run) to match the enforced action on booting); booting
    command line changed to "Run $.!BOOT"
  * Added 32-bit and 64-bit ReadFreeSpace FSFunc entries
  * Added support for interfacing with the Free module (so *ShowFree -FS CDFS
    now works)
  * Added missing * in syntax messags for *Lock and *Unlock

    now works properly
  * Added NdrDebug support
