4.1
log
@  New build variant, and some bugfixes for the SCSI variant.
Detail:
  * Added the ability to build SDFSFiler. Interrim sprite kindly furnished
    by Steve Revill.
  * Backup menu item is now always shaded for SCSIFS (and SDFS) since these
    filing systems are not currently supported by the backup code.
  * Share menu is shaded for SCSI::5 - SCSI::7 since there are no CMOS bits
    for those drives.
  * Fixed a bug where selecting "Not shared" for SCSI::4 didn't update CMOS.
Admin:
  Tested on a beagleboard.

Version 1.04. Tagged as 'ADFSFiler-1_04'
