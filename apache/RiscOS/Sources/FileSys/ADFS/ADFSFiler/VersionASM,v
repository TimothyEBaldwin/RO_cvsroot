@Fix null pointer dereference when building floppy Format menu
Detail:
  s/ADFSFiler - The commenting out of the MOV R5,#0 line in a previous bug fix left a null pointer dereference in the code when EnumFormats_Flags is checked. Examination of the code suggests the intent was to use the MOV R5,#0 to skip the EnumFormats_Flags check, so modify the preceeding CMP to check for R5=0 or R0=0.

  Tested in Iyonix ROM softload
  Fixes issue #436

@Standardise drag-to-iconbar system variable name
While the behaviour introduced with Ursula whereby files can be dropped on the iconbar filer icon to start a copy/move operation, there is a hidden bit of functionality that you can set an alternative destination directory other than the root.
This is governed by a system variable, however Acorn's implementation erroneously called this a path, when in fact it's a directory (no trailing dot). RISC OS Ltd fixed this by the time RISC OS 4.00 came along, so this change brings this filer into sync.
For reference, the variable is "FSTitle + Filer$DefaultDir", where FSTitle can be found by calling OS_FSControl 33. eg. SCSIFiler$DefaultDir SDFSFiler$DefaultDir ADFSFiler$DefaultDir

@Fix for weird text in floppy format menu
The menu icon block for the various native format floppy discs was writing the length and validation string pointers the wrong way round. By chance, there's now a vaguely valid validation string character at the address of the length of the "ADFS 1600K (F+)" entry, which made is into a string of 'o's for some reason.
Also, corrected the width calculation for half a system font character at either end - not that relevant as the Wimp's calculated it for years.
Tested briefly in an IOMD ROM, menu looks right.

@Fix null pointer dereference querying the current format of a disc
The code that issues Service_IdentifyDisc in order to populate the 'Format > Current Format' menu entry has since the dawn of time passed in R8=0 as the private word pointer. It seems to have thought setting up R12 for the filing system in question was all that was needed, not realising that FileCore ignores Service_IdentifyDisc for all but the base incarnation (R12=0).
Prior to FileCore 3.50 this didn't seem to matter since FileCore had already messed about reading sectors and hence the map area already existed, FileCore 3.50 is smarter, but as a side effect does need R8 to be valid so the allocation can be apportioned to the right instantiation.
Menu population ammended to use a different OS_Module call to get the private word, then fiddle it into a private word pointer for the duration of the work.

Tested on IOMD with all 7 floppy types it offers in the menu.

  * Backup menu item is now always shaded for SCSIFS (and SDFS) since these
    filing systems are not currently supported by the backup code.
  * Share menu is shaded for SCSI::5 - SCSI::7 since there are no CMOS bits
    for those drives.
  * Fixed a bug where selecting "Not shared" for SCSI::4 didn't update CMOS.

@Fix errors on attempting to backup or verify.
Firstly, when ADFS is not in ROM there are no ADFSFiler resources, and the verify and backup templates were being read from that directory. Copied the logic from s.ADFSFiler to try SCSIFiler resources first and fallback if absent.
This then exposed some code in the backup loop that had been missed in 32 bitting, leading to an explosion on the first UpCall.
Trimmed out a few unnecessary instructions so the module hasn't got any bigger.
Deleted 2D templates.

@Fix ADFSFiler/SCSIFiler to refuse to start their WIMP task if ADFS/SCSI module is missing
Detail:
  s/ADFSFiler - For as long as CVS history has recorded, SetUpIconBar has always had the behaviour of exiting with EXITS if the first ADFS/SCSI SWI call fails. This was causing the calling code to think that everything was fine, when really the module should have reported the error to the user/system. This has no been fixed, so attempting to start ADFSFiler/SCSIFiler without the underlying FS module being available now results in an error message.

@Modify ADFSFiler/SCSIFiler sources so that SCSIFiler is no longer dependent on ADFSFiler's resources and resource path variable
Detail:
  s/ADFSFiler - Instead of blindly loading its templates from ADFSFiler:Templates, SCSIFiler now tries two locations - SCSFiler:Templates and ADFSFiler:Templates
  Makefile - By specifying the 'SCSITEMPLATES=yes' option, the shared templates file will now be placed in SCSIFiler's resources instead of just ADFSFiler's.
  Together these changes allow ADFS-less builds (e.g. OMAP) to avoid including the ADFSFiler module in their ROM, thus saving a bit of extra space and avoiding any issues caused by ADFSFiler not behaving sensibly when the ADFS module isn't present

@  Merged in SCSIFiler.
Detail:
  SCSIFiler was obviously adapted from ADFSFiler sources, so the obvious
  approach to getting an up-to-date SCSIFiler is to make it a build variant
  of ADFSFiler. Run amu with
    COMPONENT=SCSIFiler ASFLAGS="-PD \"SCSI SETL {TRUE}\""
  to build SCSIFiler.
Admin:
  Overhauled versioning because SCSIFiler is already somewhat ahead of
  ADFSFiler in version numbers, and we don't want to bump ADFSFiler's version
  up too much jusr because of this. They will automatically remain a fixed
  distance apart.

@Fix from Kevin for the verifying of "BigDiscs",erm,so they actually
work.
Fix for problem when the disc is so knackered that the transition
between formatting -> verifying failed,used to free the "fm_" block
which on return to the polling routine lead to trying to read a bum
area of memory.

@Disc name in backup given R2 validation.
Disc name in verify given R2 validation.
Disc name during formatting made shaded to show it's not editable.
Took the opportunity to fix the red/green bar length which fell off the
end of the box during backup,format,and verify.Someone had tried to fix
it in 1995 by moving the bar back a bit on the templates,but this just
meant it overlapped at both ends! Fix was to subtract an extra 4 from
the maxbarwidth (since there are borders at *both* ends).
Corrected templates for above fix (German ones were OK).
Moved Menus dir into the attic.

log
@  Fix for bug in datasave handler, and iconbar positioning fault.
Detail:
  * The iconbar position is determined by the first character of the
    indirection data. If this is 'f' it's a floppy disc and gets a floppy
    discs position, otherwise it's a harddisc. The first character of the
    indirection data is a 'S' to indicate it is a sprite. The correct
    operation is now performed.
  * Message DataSave is only dealt with if it applies to an iconbar icon,
    and not if it's any old icon.
Admin:
  Tested and works fine. However, ShareFS now appears in the wrong
  position (between harddiscs and floppydiscs). It might be wise to update
  the position of ShareFS on the iconbar to rectify this.
