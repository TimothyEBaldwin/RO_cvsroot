4.1
log
@  Merged in SCSIFiler.
Detail:
  SCSIFiler was obviously adapted from ADFSFiler sources, so the obvious
  approach to getting an up-to-date SCSIFiler is to make it a build variant
  of ADFSFiler. Run amu with
    COMPONENT=SCSIFiler ASFLAGS="-PD \"SCSI SETL {TRUE}\""
  to build SCSIFiler.
Admin:
  Overhauled versioning because SCSIFiler is already somewhat ahead of
  ADFSFiler in version numbers, and we don't want to bump ADFSFiler's version
  up too much jusr because of this. They will automatically remain a fixed
  distance apart.
