@Use HAL device for PATA IDE controller, and a few minor fixes
ADFS 3 is currently both a filing system and a hardware poker, so have it own the PATA device for now as a stepping stone to a PATADriver module; export the header.
No longer call HAL entries, look for the HAL device, activate, and call that instead. At API 0.00 it just has the exact same 3 functions as the previous HAL entries only refactored to pass a device pointer in R0.

Makefile/IDEDevice.hdr/ADFS.s/Adfs00.s:
  Export, include, and reserve workspace.
Adfs12.s/IDEDetect.s:
  Refactor function calls.
Messages:
  Unrelated correction to pluralisation of 'Sectors'.
Adfs50.s:
  Hunt for the IDE controller device.
  Fix oflaofla error if run on a non HAL machine - OS_Hardware errors but the ErrXFree code label expects the error pointer in R9 not R0.

Tested in an IOMD build.

Version 3.50. Tagged as 'ADFS-3_50'
