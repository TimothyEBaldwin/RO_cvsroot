@Remove legacy 700us DRQ timeout for write ops
Detail:
  Early versions of the ATA spec mandated that drives should assert DRQ within 700us of a write command being issued. However later versions of the spec have dropped this limit, and some devices (e.g. CF cards) are known to regularly exceed the limit.
  Remove the 700us timeout from ADFS, so that these devices can operate correctly.
  s/Adfs14 - Modify DRQ timeout check so that it will fall back to polling from TickerV if the initial 700us loop times out.
  s/StaticsIDE - Add extra word to workspace, so that the TickerV routine can still timeout the operation
Admin:
  Tested on IOMD (~4M FSBash ops), Tungsten (~500K FSBash ops)
  Fixes "disc error 20" seen when using IDE-CF adapter on RiscPC, thanks to reasarch by Jon Abbot:

@Calculate the offset to the hardware-dependent information
Don't assume that the disc address to MiscOp_Mount is always &C00, in order to locate the hardware-dependent information (see PRM 2-215), calculate the offset properly. This fixes a problem that FileCore 3.74 triggered where the LBA flag was no longer being recovered now the alignment of the request in R2 has changed, causing some drives to no longer mount if they also don't support CHS addressing.
Strictly speaking there's no guarantee that FileCore is even asking for the boot block at all; ADFS should read the sectors itself before fulfilling the request, but historically it's always assumed that the boot block was being read, so let sleeping dogs lie.

@Use HAL device for PATA IDE controller, and a few minor fixes
ADFS 3 is currently both a filing system and a hardware poker, so have it own the PATA device for now as a stepping stone to a PATADriver module; export the header.
No longer call HAL entries, look for the HAL device, activate, and call that instead. At API 0.00 it just has the exact same 3 functions as the previous HAL entries only refactored to pass a device pointer in R0.

Makefile/IDEDevice.hdr/ADFS.s/Adfs00.s:
  Export, include, and reserve workspace.
Adfs12.s/IDEDetect.s:
  Refactor function calls.
Messages:
  Unrelated correction to pluralisation of 'Sectors'.
Adfs50.s:
  Hunt for the IDE controller device.
  Fix oflaofla error if run on a non HAL machine - OS_Hardware errors but the ErrXFree code label expects the error pointer in R9 not R0.

@Reinstate floppies on IOMD platform
ADFS.s:
  Remove redundant header file.
Adfs05.s/Adfs15.s:
  Group the options a bit more simply, use {TRUE} and {FALSE}.
Adfs12.s/BusMaster.s/IDEDetect.s:
  Use defines instead of magic numbers.
Adfs17.s:
  Organise the offsets from the floppy controller to cover both PCI and IO based controllers.
  Only do the dummy read from the PBI on Tungsten.
Adfs18.s:
  Implement the FIQ equivalent of the 'FlpUseVerify' command switch, modern controllers (!) have a built in verify rather than using a sector read, but the verify command has no data phase and the FIQ handler was sitting waiting for a sector that never arrives.
  Rationalise FlpDRQmask and FlpDRQmaskbit.
Adfs19:
  Rationalise the calls to OS_Hardware by rejigging the assembly time switches.
  Reinstate the non HAL version of IRQ enable for reference.
  On RPCEmu 0.8.8 and 0.8.9 the emulator hangs during the four set of DCB's used to autodetect the drive (Recalibrate/Seek/Seek/Sense) which seems to be due to the way the emulator splits CPU time to floppy emulation time, to avoid this we wait 128us (real time) which is enough emulated time for the controller to have changed state. You probably just want to *CONFIGURE FLOPPIES 0 though.

Tested om A7000, ARM610, StrongARM manipulating a veriety of disc densities for read and write. Also ran the "Test/TestADFS" test program.
RPCEmu 0.8.8 and 0.8.9 boots still, but no attempt has been made to use emulated floppies.

@  Minor bugfix to MiscOp 1 for '765 floppy disc driver
Detail:
  If the sequence number did not have the expected value on entry (i.e. the
  caller had missed at least one state change) then the driver always reported
  Changed, even for floppy drives without a working disc changed line. This
  was the only time when Changed was reported for such drives - now it reports
  MaybeChanged in this case, which is consistent with the 1772 floppy driver.
  Also removed the confusingly-named (and unused) symbols DefectStruc and
  DefectCheck, in line with similar changes to SCSIFS and FileCore.
Admin:
  Untested, but should be a safe change.

@  Retired FileCore_Create "No directory state" startup option
Detail:
  Despite what the PRM says about *Configure options Dir and NoDir, the
  CMOS bit which they control was actually read by the filing systems and
  passed to FileCore via register R3 passed to FileCore_Create. In practice,
  only ADFS appears to have done this correctly. However, since RISC OS 3.00,
  FileCore has not managed the CSD (this function being taken over by
  FileSwitch) so this option hasn't actually done anything for the last
  21 years! Given that the other FileCore filing systems have managed fine
  without the Dir/NoDir option being set correctly, I think the time has come
  to stop using this part of the FileCore_Create API, which means we can free
  up a bit of CMOS.
Admin:
  Builds but not tested, but a very low-risk change.

@Update to work with zero page relocation
Detail:
  s/ADFS, s/Adfs00, s/Adfs50 - Use OS_ReadSysInfo 6 to get ESC_Status location and store it in module workspace
  s/Adfs05 - Updated debug code to use OS_ReadSysInfo 6 to get IRQsema location. Updated CheckEscape to use local ESC_Status pointer, and updated it to only be compiled if it's actually needed
  s/Adfs10, s/Adfs14, s/Adfs15, s/Adfs17 - Use local ESC_Status pointer
Admin:
  Tested (with low processor vectors) in Iyonix ROM softload
  Note that FIQ handlers haven't been updated to support high vectors, since they aren't currently used on any hardware capable of using high vectors

@Update IOMD HAL build to use OS_Memory 9 instead of HAL_ControllerAddress for finding the floppy controller
Detail:
  s/Adfs19 - The (currently disabled) floppy code now uses OS_Memory 9 to look for controller 34 instead of the less-portable (and allocation clashing) HAL_ControllerAddress (to look for controller 6).
Admin:
  Compiles but untested. IOMD floppy support is broken at the moment anyway.

@IOMD/HAL build fixes
Detail:
  s/Adfs12 - Don't use DefaultIDEHardware in HAL builds, use the proper addresses instead
  s/Adfs19 - Make floppy code use HAL_ControllerAddress to get 82C710 address in non-PCI, non-Podule, HAL builds. However floppy code is currently disabled in this configuration because it hangs the machine when floppy access is attempted.
  s/Consts, s/StaticsIDE - Get rid of some bad address constants for HAL builds
Admin:
  Tested in Iyonix & IOMD ROM softloads.

log
@  Reintroduced support for IOMD machines
Detail:
  There was no "Ver" file for Machine=32, and the code for build switch
  settings appropriate for IOMD had not been kept up-to-date with various
  changes to the module which were made to support Tungsten. This version
  provides working IDE support for IOMD HAL builds, although there are
  still some issues with floppy support. Tungsten builds should be
  functionally identical.
Admin:
  Tested on a Risc PC. Joint development effort by Tom Walker and Ben Avison.

@  Build change
Detail:
  CPU version is no longer specified in the makefile - it's better to inherit
  it from the build environment now that we actually set it appropriately.
Admin:
  Not tested. Binary should be unchanged - this only affects the warnings
  generated during assembly.

@First bits of DMA support: reads bus master information from the HAL and

Also responds to Service_ModulePostInit for the DMA Manager to reregister

log
@  Loading to/saving from top-bit-set addresses should now work.
Detail:
  The problem was in the API definition of the scatter lists used in
  background data transfer. These consist of a sequence of word pairs,
  holding addresses and lengths; any negative (ie top-bit-set) address word
  is defined to mean that the list continues at an location that is offset
  by that amount. To get around this, the check is now made not on whether
  the address word is negative, but on whether it is equal to or greater
  than (less negative than) &FFFF0000. This means that accesses to these
  addresses will still fail, but such addresses should be reserved for
  system use anyway.
Admin:
  Tested briefly.

@  Ursula_RiscPC branch merged.

Detail:
  The Ursula_RiscPC branch contained version 3.30 of ADFS, which had
  minimal updates for Ursula, such as the service call table. This
  version, incorporating changes on the Ursula branch up to
  the Ursula_RiscPC_bp tag, is now merged on to the trunk as 3.32.
  This leaves version 3.31 on the Ursula branch, unmerged. This contains
  unfinished support for auto-detection of IDE drives and support for
  Phoebe hardware.
