ADFS.s:
  Redundant header files trimmed
  Get OsWords and OsBytes
  Switches rationalised
ADFS_SA.a
  Removed ARM810 support
Adfs00.s:
  Unused MEMC flag removed
Adfs05.s/Adfs12.s/Adfs13.s/Adfs14.s/Adfs15.s/Adfs19.s:
  Use defines instead of magic numbers
  Make use of FileCore exported bit fields
Adfs17.s/Adfs18.s/ConstIDE:
  {TRUE} and {FALSE} used with objasm
Adfs20.s
  Use AND of the opmask instead of BIC of all the flags except the opmask
Adfs50.s
  Unused MEMC flag no longer initialised
  Make use of FileCore exported bit fields
  Service call table reordered so the Ursula despatch doesn't incur a branch
  OsByte defines used
Consts:
  Removed those definitions now duplicating FileCore's exports
DebugOpts/Fixes:
  All options brought under one roof
ModHeader:
  Now uses VersionNum directly

@  Reintroduced support for IOMD machines
Detail:
  There was no "Ver" file for Machine=32, and the code for build switch
  settings appropriate for IOMD had not been kept up-to-date with various
  changes to the module which were made to support Tungsten. This version
  provides working IDE support for IOMD HAL builds, although there are
  still some issues with floppy support. Tungsten builds should be
  functionally identical.
Admin:
  Tested on a Risc PC. Joint development effort by Tom Walker and Ben Avison.

@First bits of DMA support: reads bus master information from the HAL and
uses it to create a set of DMA "HAL" devices for use by the DMA Manager.
Also responds to Service_ModulePostInit for the DMA Manager to reregister
(currently only the floppy) DMA channel(s).
