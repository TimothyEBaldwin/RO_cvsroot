4.1
log
@  Reintroduced support for IOMD machines
Detail:
  There was no "Ver" file for Machine=32, and the code for build switch
  settings appropriate for IOMD had not been kept up-to-date with various
  changes to the module which were made to support Tungsten. This version
  provides working IDE support for IOMD HAL builds, although there are
  still some issues with floppy support. Tungsten builds should be
  functionally identical.
Admin:
  Tested on a Risc PC. Joint development effort by Tom Walker and Ben Avison.
