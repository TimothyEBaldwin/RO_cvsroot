@  Ursula_RiscPC branch merged.

Detail:
  The Ursula_RiscPC branch contained version 3.30 of ADFS, which had
  minimal updates for Ursula, such as the service call table. This
  version, incorporating changes on the Ursula branch up to
  the Ursula_RiscPC_bp tag, is now merged on to the trunk as 3.32.
  This leaves version 3.31 on the Ursula branch, unmerged. This contains
  unfinished support for auto-detection of IDE drives and support for
  Phoebe hardware.
