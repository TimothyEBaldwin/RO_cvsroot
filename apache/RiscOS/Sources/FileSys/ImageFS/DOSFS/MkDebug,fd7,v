4.2
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Replaced 'lk' register name with 'lr', now APCS is not set to -none.
Inverted the sense of the conditional in CMHG file, following the more common ROM predefine use (eg. the Toolbox).
Removed obsolete NoFAT32 obey files - the switch remains but there's little point omitting that now (since the switch actually leaves most of the code in anyway).
Tested in IOMD ROM build (export, resources, ROM phases) mounting a DOS floppy and 1GB image file.

4.1
log
@   Update of DOSFS to handle Long File Names and FAT32 (up to 2GB)
Detail:
   Extend DOSFS to correctly recognise FAT32 DOS images and to
   use the Long File Name extensions. NOTE that there is still
   a 2gb size limit imposed by the max filecore image file
   size limitiations. NOTE also that as yet there is no support for
   UTF encoding of file names.
Admin:
   Tested at castle and with beta testers.
   Modifications are castle and castle assigned IP (from CJB)
