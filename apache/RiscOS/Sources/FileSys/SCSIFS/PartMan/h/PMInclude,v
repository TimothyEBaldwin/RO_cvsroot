log
@  Improved reboot behaviour, and added routines to check for boot disc.
Detail:
  Various routines added to detect and help prevent formatting of
  current boot disc. Also improved detection of already mounted discs
  when PartMan is rebooted.
Admin:
 tested on iMx6

log
@  Extend PartMan behaviour and add SWI and *command to list the
  detected partition start addresses and lengths. Improve
  interaction with SCSIFS.
Detail:
  Improved robustness. Made tolerant of some obstinate USB SD card
  readers that previously would cause the system to lock whilst the device
  was plugged in.
Admin:
  tested on iMx6

log
@   More work on filecore format routine.
Detail:
   The routine embedded in the sources will now write a correct filecore format
   across the full range of IDLen values, though in use it will generally select
   the largest IDLen value as this permits the most files to be stored on disc.
Admin:
   tested in iMx6

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of PartMan module
Detail:
  This is early work. It can be used 'manually' to format up a disc using
  the GPT partition header system. Current working format is filecore, though
  with a non optimal format. Functional, but work in progress.
