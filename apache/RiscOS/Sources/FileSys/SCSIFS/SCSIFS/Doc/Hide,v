log
@ 	Updated SCSIFS with a mechanism to ignore HotPlug SCSI drives
   	that are not required.
Detail:
	Typically USB card readers contain several readers as different LUNs.
	Usually a user is not interested in all readers and some can safely
	be ignored. There is now a mechanism in SCSIFS to remember this.
	(otherwise readers can occupy all the available icons, making it
	impossible for a user to add other devices e.g. 'pens'.)
	A new file, Boot:Choices.SCSIFS.Hide, is used to store data on
	sub-devices for which no SCSIFS 'drive' is desired. This data
	is the 8 byte Vendor + 16 byte Product + 4 byte Revision fields
	(concatenated and LF terminated) returned by the SCSI Inquiry command.
	If a device/LUN's inquiry completely mateches a file entry, no
	SCSIFS drive will be created. A simple App will be created to manage
	this file in due course.
Admin:  TESTED AT Castle.. due for beta release.
