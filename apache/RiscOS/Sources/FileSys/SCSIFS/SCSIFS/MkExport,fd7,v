@  Reworked error code
Detail:
  Now uses Hdr:FileCoreErr rather than containing its own definitions of the
  low-level FileCore error numbers. Autogenerates and exports a new header,
  Hdr:SCSIFSErr, and a C version of the same, containing error definitions
  within the SCSIFS error block, derived from the error offsets from
  Hdr:FileCoreErr. hdr.MyErrors is now only used to list the errors for
  which an error block needs to be allocated for SCSIFS's own use.
Admin:
  Only functional change is that *Configure SCSIFSdrive now returns the
  correct error number if an invalid drive is specified (previously the
  error number was miscalculated).

Version 1.24. Tagged as 'SCSIFS-1_24'
