@  Reworked error code
Detail:
  Now uses Hdr:FileCoreErr rather than containing its own definitions of the
  low-level FileCore error numbers. Autogenerates and exports a new header,
  Hdr:RAMFSErr, and a C version of the same, containing error definitions
  within the RAMFS error block, derived from the error offsets from
  Hdr:FileCoreErr.
Admin:
  No changes to the binary.

Version 2.27. Tagged as 'RAMFS-2_27'
