4.1
log
@  No longer mounts RamDisc0 on startup
Detail:
  This is inconsistent behaviour compared to other FileCore filing systems.
  RAMFS was effectively behaving as though *Configure Dir had been used
  (on RISC OS 2) but since RISC OS 3, all other FileCore filing systems
  have behaved as though *Configure NoDir had been used. Since RAMFS only
  supports one drive, the only difference users are likely to notice is in
  the output of *Cat before *Dir is issued.
Admin:
  Tested using a softload on an OMAP3 machine.

Version 2.28. Tagged as 'RAMFS-2_28'
