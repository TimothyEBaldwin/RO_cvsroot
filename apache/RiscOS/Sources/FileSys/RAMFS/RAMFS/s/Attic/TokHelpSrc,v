4.2
log
@Simplify.
Change to use exports from FileCore-3_45.
Delete local copies, which then collapsed the whole module in on itself - RAMFS should really be the simplest of clients, but was built up from a lot of spare body parts. This simplification removes a lot of files.
Delete s.TokHelpSrc - this is autogenerated and was erroneously checked in a few years ago.
Delete unused Help and Syntax.
Try to get the use of BigDir/BigDisc/BigMap more correct.
Tested against FileCore-3_45 and still works.
