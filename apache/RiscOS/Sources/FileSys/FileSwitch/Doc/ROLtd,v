4.1
log
@  RISC OS Ltd changes merged onto trunk.
Detail:
  (extracted from BuffyLog)
  * Fixed problem with > 67 character filenames in OS_FSControl 26-28.
    buffer now fixed at 256 characters but lengths are now checked.

  * Paths may now be of any length without crashing fileswitch. On some
    occasions errors will be returned for long filenames (usually
    buffer overflow), but it will never crash. This does not stop other
    code (usually upcall handlers) from crashing the machine.
Admin:
  Not tested (TM). Shout at me if it doesn't work.

Version 2.51. Tagged as 'FileSwitch-2_51'

@RISCOS Ltd notes on FileSwitch
==============================

Author: Justin Fletcher
Date:   26 Mar 1999

Summary
-------
FileSwitch had a number of bugs in it when dealing with long filenames. These
prevented it from performing some operations on files whose components were
greater than 64 characters, or where the total length exceeded 1024 characters.
Limitations have been more strictly adhered to now.
