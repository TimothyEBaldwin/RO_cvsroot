4.1
log
@  Reworked error code
Detail:
  Created a new exported header file, Hdr:FileCoreErr, which will serve as
  the single centralised location that defines the error numbers used in the
  low-level FileCore interfaces. s.Errors is now only used for allocating
  error blocks, not for defining error numbers. Also now exports C versions
  of both the pre-existing Hdr:FileCore and the new header.
Admin:
  No changes to the binary.

Version 3.49. Tagged as 'FileCore-3_49'
