log
@  More 32-bit fixes.
Detail:
  Flag preservation added to 7 routines that require it.  Docs.32-bit
    updated to remove the names of the functions that have been made
    to preserve flags again.
Admin:
  This version needs more testing, but at least this version does not
    appear to stiff the machine, corrupt discs, go bang under light
    testing with ADFS and RAMFS.
  26-bit and 32-bit builds slightly tested.
  Do not use in products - Do use in test builds.

ARM_CC_Mask is no longer used as a bad FCB test. Just the bottom 2 bits of pointers are
checked (See BadPtr and BadPtrBits).

Function changes following 32-bit adaptation:

All functions still preserving flags may do so ACROSS the call, rather than
restoring the flags in LR. Beware tail-calls.
