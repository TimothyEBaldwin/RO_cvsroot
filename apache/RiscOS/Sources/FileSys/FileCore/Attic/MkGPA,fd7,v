@Reenable background transfer support when BigFiles is {TRUE}
BigDirCode.s: Retire BigDirFix switch, it wasn't actually a fix, it was more that the directory format was changed early in development, but there's no point keeping support for the prototype any more
FileCore45.s/FileCore25.s/FileCore31.s/FileCore35.s/DebugOpts.s: Retire BigDirFix
Defns.s: Shock addition of some comments
FileCore.s: Manual inclusion of CPU/Arch no longer needed
FileCore70.s: Crucially apply the same 1k dead band to the FileSwitch "write zeros" entry point, since it (along with Get/PutBytes) are the only places file offsets get passed
FileCore80.s: Lots of tedious and subtle boundary cases fixed
InitDieSvc.s: Removed the disabling switch
doc/BigDisc/ADFSBuffer: Detail what the BufFlags mean

Tested on ADFS (the only background-transferring filing system about) with LFAUs of 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k and bashing 65536 iterations.

@  Miscellaneous improvements
Detail:
  * Added the ability for a filing system to specify to FileCore that floppy
    discs should be mounted like hard discs, to complement the existing flag
    that specifies the opposite. SDFS requires this. Ideally SCSIFS should
    start using this as well, to encapsulate boot block handling within
    FileCore.
  * Added header definitions so the FileCore and the filing systems can
    negotiate the use of a new MiscOp entry, needed as part of partitioning
    support, especially important for filing systems that use the hardware-
    specific section of the boot block, like ADFS. At present, FileCore
    doesn't do anything different (it still doesn't support partitions) but
    this enables filing systems to be modified in preparation.
  * Removed the only place where FileCore paid any attention to the
    EmptyWorks flag returned by MiscOp 1 - an obscure and not very useful
    edge case not used by any current filing systems.
  * Added 650 lines of documentation for the MiscOp SWI and low-level entry
    to the Doc directory, giving the information you need in order to
    implement a FileCore filing system.
  * Added missing header file definitions for the low-level background DiscOp
    reason code and the hot-plug drive removed flag to MiscOp 7.
  * Removed some RISC OS 2 legacy code whereby FileCore maintained its idea
    of the internal disc address of the CSD @@, PSD \, Library % and URD & for
    each filing system. Since RISC OS 3.00, FileSwitch handles these
    internally and passes canonicalised paths to FileCore, so FileCore's disc
    addresses for these directories remained unset. This allows some
    considerable simplification of FileCore's path parser in particular, but
    also affects other code like that which decides how to expire disc
    records. Also note that FileCore has been unable to generate certain
    errors (like "Can't delete current directory") since RISC OS 3.00 for the
    same reason.
  * Changed loading of the map for FileCore-format discs so that the map is
    loaded into the dynamic area during the Service_IdentifyDisc handler in
    one big DiscOp rather than loading it twice, sector-by-sector, via one
    big sector cache. For one thing, the sector cache is implemented
    inefficiently - O(n^2) - and for another thing, single-sector DiscOps are
    relatively inefficient on many filing systems, especially on SD cards.
    Some example speed-ups measured for mounting discs are:
      SCSIFS,   1GB drive: was 0.62 sec, now 0.40 sec (1.55 x speedup)
      SCSIFS, 256GB drive: was 1.44 sec, now 0.52 sec (2.77 x speedup)
      SDFS,     2GB drive: was 1.25 sec, now 0.14 sec (8.93 x speedup)
Admin:
  Tested on a beagleboard, with SCSIFS and SDFS.
