@Delete some dead code
Since PipeFS registers with FileSwitch with both dontuseload and dontusesave there's no need to implement the corresponding FSEntry_File subreasons. This might have been left around because RISC OS 2 ignored FS info word flags b23-16, but we're not worrying about RISC OS 2 compatibility now.

@Fix for NULL pointer access reporting monitor name
PipeFS was carefully preserving R6 (the special field pointer, which is 0 for PipeFS) in the places where FileSwitch expects to get the leafname back when *OPT1,2 is enabled, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference in FileSwitch. Update R6 per the spec.
Delete old switch justreturnextent from version 0.06.
Delete unused Help & Syntax, these are now in Resources/UK.

@  Fixed Sleep No More, and made 32-bit compatible.

Detail:
  PipeFS uses UpCall 6 (Sleep) to signal that the reading process can sleep,
using the size of the file as a pollword.  Thus when any data is written into
the pipe, the sleeping process will be woken up.  If an attempt is made to
close the file handle, UpCall 7 (Sleep No More) is broadcast to allow anyone
to object to the closure occurring.  Pipe_Close wasn't checking the error
return from making this call, which was an error.  It will now propogate this
error up to fileswitch upon an attempt being made to close the file while a
process is sleeping on it.

  32-bitness involved changing a load of TEQPs for RestPSRs, and fixing some
functions which had forgotten to use [sp, #Proc_RegOffset].

  Also added !Mk and added stripdepend to MkClean.

Admin:
  Tested on dev board and RiscPC running a fairly recent Ursula build.

log
@  File heap moved to private dynamic area; much more efficient UpCall
  generation.
Detail:
  Use of the RMA by PipeFS could lead to fragmentation, and is slower
  than a private dynamic area as the RMA's a very busy heap. The new
  dynamic area is set to 16MB maximum size, called "PipeFS", and the
  code is compile-time switched, not run-time.

  PipeFS has no block handling code so its get/put byte routines are
  called by the OS in a tight loop. Unfortunately for each byte it
  reads/writes it issues UpCall_ModifyingFile, and moreover does this
  without specifying a filename, so *all* directories are rescanned -
  for every single byte read or written to PipeFS. This is why PipeFS
  is so extremely slow prior to this version. Now, a callback is set,
  and the UpCall only issued when this goes off - after any block
  transfers, for example. A typical effect is a 171K file save from a
  text editor to PipeFS used to take around 20 seconds, and now takes
  less than a quarter of a second. Streaming data through PipeFS is
  now a sensible option.

  There are two variants of the callback code; one maintans an array
  of filename pointers and goes through the list each time the call-
  back fires; the other just issues a general UpCall each time. The
  first one should work OK, and is there in case anyone ever works
  out how to use R1 properly for the UpCall.
Admin:
  Copied files into PipeFS up to the DA limit and verified sensible
  behaviour at this point; memory released as expected on file
  removal; files appear to be intact; MP3 streaming at 128kbps from
  network or disc through PipeFS is reliable; Filer window behaviour
  with "full info" on and Task Manager display of dynamic area size
  act as expected.

  By default, the compile-time options mean the module will only run on
  RISC OS 3.5 or later. Tested on RISC OS 3.70 only.
