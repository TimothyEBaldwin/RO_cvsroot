2. Outstanding Issues
   There are no outstanding issues


3. Product Overview

     The joystick module for Risc OS Black is to provide support for up to two
   joysticks on a MORRIS platform (eg Kryten). It will support both Atari-style
   (digital, one fire button) and PC-style (analogue, 2 fire buttons) joysticks.
   At any given time though, only one mode of operation will be required due to
|  the hardware implementation (jumpers on the interface board configure the
|  interface type).
|    To enable a wide variety of analogue joysticks to be used, an application
|  will be supplied that allows the joysticks to be calibrated from the desktop.
|  This prevents the need for each program to include its own calibration routines.



4. Concepts & Definitions
     As per the PC-style joystick standard, the voltage minima & maxima are as
   defined in the diagram below, for analogue joysticks. In the software, the
   default range will be -127 to +127, in order to match the existing SWI.
   Alternatively, 16-bit values can be returned, depending on a SWI flag (see
   section 6).
|    Note that not all 'PC-style' analogue joysticks adhere to the standard, but
|  these are corrected on a calibration, so that they appear to comply to the
|  standard.
   

                                     ^ MaxY (Up)
                                     |
                                     |
                   MinX (Left) <-----+-----> MaxX (Right)
                                     |
                                     |
                                     v MinY (Down)

     For digital (atari-type) joysticks, Left = -64, Right = 64, Down = -64 and
   Up = 64. Any other value is assumed to be the 'centred' position.



5. User Interface
     There are no *commands supported by this module. Note that the module
   determines the interface type at initialisation, so dynamic configuration of
   the interface is not possible.

|    An application called !Calibrate is supplied with the joystick module. This
|  allows the user to calibrate analogue joysticks before use (this is necessary
|  because of the variations in joystick design). Once this application has
|  been run by the user, the returned analogue values from the Joystick_Read
|  SWI will cover the full range (0-65535), rather than an arbitrary subset.



6. Programmer Interface
     The new module is intended to use a very similar (and backwards-compatible)
|  calling interface to the module developed for the A3010. It also defines two new
|  SWIs to enable calibration of analogue joysticks.

   SWI: Joystick_Read (&43F40)

   Returns the state of a joystick

   On entry
        R0  bits 0-7:   joystick number
            bits 8-15:  reason code:  0 -> return 8-bit values
                                      1 -> return 16-bit values (only applicable
                                                                 to analogue)
            bits 16-31: reserved (0)

   On exit
      If Reason code = 0 (return 8-bit values)
        R0  
            Byte    Value
              0     Signed Y axis value, range -127 to +127
              1     Signed X axis value, range -127 to +127
              2     Switch statuses, starting in bit 0.
              3     Reserved



      If Reason code = 1 (return 16-bit values)
        R0  bits 0-15:  Unsigned Y value in the range 0 to 65535
            bits 16-31: Unsigned X value in the range 0 to 65535

        R1  bits 0-7:  Switches (eg fire buttons) as specified in RO3 PRMs
            bits 8-31: Reserved

   Interrupts
        Interrupt status is unaltered
        Fast interrupts are enabled

   Processor mode
        Processor is in SVC mode

   Re-entrancy
        Not defined

   Use
        This SWI is used to obtain the state of the requested joystick.


  If the hardware interface is configured for an analogue joystick, then the
initial call to the SWI will always return X=0, Y=0, no switches closed.
  The analogue routine makes use of a VSync-driven periodic routine that
updates a 'magic location' with the latest readings. This allows the SWI to
quickly read these locations & return, without the unacceptable overhead of
having to wait for a conversion to complete. The digital routine simply looks
directly at the hardware for the latest readings.

If the interface is configured to analogue, then the standard ADC OSBYTEs are
also available (16, 17, 128, 188 - 190), as is the ADVAL command in BASIC.
This is to retain backwards compatibility with the I/O Podule. Note that the
15-pin joystick connector is differently wired to the I/O Podule's ADC port, and
so some kind of adaptor cable will be required to allow ADC port devices to be
connected to the joystick port. Also, the ADC port only supports 2 switches,
whereas the joystick port provides four (2 per joystick). For the ADVAL and
OSBYTE commands, the ADC port device switch should be mapped to fire button 0.

Also, note that if both a joystick interface and an I/O podule are present in
the machine, that the OSBYTEs and ADVAL command will be linked to the ADC
port on the I/O podule. The SWI will still access the joystick port though.     


|  SWI: Joystick_CalibrateTopRight (&43F41)
| 
|  One of the pair of SWIs to calibrate an analogue joystick so that the Read
|  SWI returns the full range of values (0 to 65535 or -128 to +128)
|
|  On Entry
|      No entry parameters
|       
|  On Exit
|      All registers preserved     
|      
|  On calling this SWI, the joystick should be in the top-right position.
|
|
|  SWI: Joystick_CalibrateBottomLeft (&43F42)
| 
|  One of the pair of SWIs to calibrate an analogue joystick so that the Read
|  SWI returns the full range of values (0 to 65535 or -128 to +128)
|
|  On Entry
|      No entry parameters
|       
|  On Exit
|      All registers preserved     
|      
|  On calling this SWI, the joystick should be in the bottom-left position.
|
| NOTE: After one of these SWIs has been called, the ADVAL and Read SWI return
| errors until the other calibration SWI is called.
     



7. Standards
     The code is assembled with !ObjAsm.



8. Data Interchange
     There are no data interchange formats defined by this project.



9. Data Formats
     There are no new data formats defined by this project.



10.External Dependencies
     Medusa hardware
     MORRIS (for analogue joystick)
     Digital Joystick board prototype (required for both digital & analogue)



11.Acceptance Test
     Must function on Medusa & Kryten hardware. Also, in analogue mode, the
Vsync-attached routine should not consume more than 1% of the CPU time in
mode 13 (320x256x256, a common games mode) on the Kryten hardware.
     Should require less than 3Kb of memory for the module and its workspace.



12.Development Test Strategy
     A program will be written to graphically relay the values being read
from the joystick to the screen. This will allow the linearity of the
analogue response to be tested, as well as to ensure the joystick module
allows equal range for both axes, and an acceptable response time.
 note that it may be wise to try a selection of joysticks, as resistances
(and thus, overall range) will vary between them.
