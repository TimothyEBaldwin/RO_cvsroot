@Switch out non functional digital joysticks
They were already switched out, since they're not wired up to anything, but using an obsolete switch.
Changed error blocks to use error base from Hdr:NewErrors.
Builds, but not tested.

@Overhauled to work in a 32 bit HALised world.
Though this module had been 32 bitted in 2001, a mistake in its header meant that the flags word was in the wrong place and hence rejected on a 32 bit system. This masked the fact that it was doing much peeking and poking of 0x0320xxxx addresses.
Reworked to use system API to find out where stuff is and peek and poke indirectly.
Added documentation on how the hardware should be wired up (while it's unlikely that hardware will be made, emulator authors can use this info to connect to PC joysticks).
hdr.Joystick:
  SWI flags defined for callers
Front.s:
  Change IO registers to be IOMD_Base relative
  Remove some unused definitions, include some include files
Modhead.s:
  Put the flags word at the right offset in the header
  Rewrite detection logic, now it's check for 7500/7500FE version
  of IOMD, then look for a podule with simple id of "Analogue joystick"
  in the NIC slot, then read its address
  Retabbed
SWI.s:
  Return the fire buttons in the right bits for joystick #1
  Retab and use OsByte header definition
Ticky.s:
  Access via addresses read in the setup step
Service.s:
  Retab and use OsByte header definition
