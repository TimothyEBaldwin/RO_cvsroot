  * Removed dependency on obsolete STB flag.

Detail:

  * STB versions of the module provided support for RCA and IDEA keyboards.
    Support for the RCA variant has been dormant since October 1998: the
    RCASupport flag has been set to FALSE ever since.  I've taken the
    opportunity to remove the code in this version.

    Likewise, support for IDEA keyboards has been similarly removed, but
    only because there is no record of them having been used at all in
    any product, and certainly not recently.  (If required, use CVS to
    merge the support back into later versions.)

    The result of the above activity is that both Desktop and Embedded
    versions are identical, no longer reliant on the STB flag and not
    requiring the new Embedded_UI flag.

Admin:

  * Built and tested on Lazarus 32-bit build.  Desktop variant of the code
    is binary identical to previous versions.

  * StripDepnd support moved from the Makefile to MkClean.

  * Removed build-specific directories in "rm", since these are created
    during assembly.
