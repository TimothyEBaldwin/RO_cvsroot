us a tag we can associate with the official RISC OS 5.16 release.

@  Bug fix to Buffer_Threshold.

Detail:
  A threshold value of -1 is meant to do a read, it was however also causing
an UpCall to occur because during 32bit conversion, the PSR was being
restored before checking for a flag that this was trashing.

  This bug affected 26bit builds as well and may have caused the odd
spurious bufferemptying/filling upcall.

Admin:
  Threshold UpCall no longer occurs when reading threshold. (Tested on RPC).

@  Fixed some interrupt holes.
Detail:
  At a couple of points, the Buffer Manager would re-enable interrupts
    when it should not have done so.  These holes are now fixed.  Some
    other code has been optimised in light of extensions made to the
    CPU macros after this component was originally made 32-bit safe.
Admin:
  Built.

@  Another attempt to get free buffer space reported correctly.
Detail:
  This has got to win some sort of award. The buffer manager service routine
  (reason code 7) and CnpV were _still_ getting the result wrong.

  Buffer_GetInfo (which uses a separate calculation) has been modified to
  ensure it returns the same result for free and used space when word-aligned
  buffers in use.

Detail:

  * See summary, above.  Basically the calculation of the free space

  Alterations to fix bugs introduced in V0.27 when the word-aligned
  buffer support was added.

Detail:

  Added the missing "Buffer must be word aligned" error message to the
  German resources (although the sentence is in English).

  Non-internationalised version was missing the "Buffer must be word
  aligned" message; this has now been rectified.

  The buffer manager service routine "Return free space" (reason code
  number 7) was incorrectly calculating the free space.  Instead of
  using the size of the buffer and insertion point in the calculation
  it was using an uninitialised register and the reason code!  This
  was due to a change made in V0.27 to the stack environment which
  invalidated the usage of R0 and R1.  Registers R6 and R7 are now
  used in place of these.

Admin:

  Tested by softloading on an NC1 using the baseline Lazarus OS image.
  Fixes verified as being correct.
