@  Added support for default strings and indirect tags pointing to strings.
  Tidied up indirect tags pointing to integer values.
Detail:
  If the default field is enclosed in quotes it is taken as being a string
   the escape character is currently a forward slash. Any character apart from
   '\0' may be used in the string so in theory any data type could be encoded
   provided it doesn't need a 0 byte anywhere in it. Infact this would be easy
   to fix - the removal of the escape characters could be done as the string
   is copied into the cache buffer so 0 bytes could be escaped.
  When a string is read and temporary buffer is allocated and it's address is
   returned in the value field. To indicate this a bit in the flag word is set
   LOCATION_FLAGS_POINTER - this bit is not useful outside the module but is
   returned by NVRAM_Lookup.

  c/nvram
   FullReset & LockedReset both modified to understand what to do if
 		LOCATION_FLAGS_POINTER is set
   GetLocation now takes an extra argument either TRUE or FALSE that
		is passed to parse_description. This is to signify whether
		or not the caller requires a default value to be looked up
		and returned. This should be FALSE (0) for all normal routines,
		and TRUE for routines involved in reset code.
  c/parse
   parse_description takes an extra argument as described above which is passed
		to GetDefaultValue.
   GetDefaultValue has been heavily modified to understand strings and the
		indirection code is different to cope with strings. It also
		takes a pointer to a flag word (see GetFlags below)
   GetFlags now takes a pointer to the flag word and modifies it so that
		GetDefaultValue can set the LOCATION_FLAGS_POINTER bit
Admin:
  A limited amount of testing has taken place but it needs testing in a real
   situation.
  It seems a bit messy in several places and consideration should be given to
   rewriting those functions which are relevant to reseting the NVRAM and the
   routines in c/parse. Separating these a bit would probably allow a tidier
   implementation of the new functionality in this version.

log
@  NVRAM tags checker code updated to support indirected tags.
Detail:
  * Indirected tag checking support added to identify tags which refer to
    tags which don't exist or cyclic dependencies.
  * Initial work to allow Throwback to be dropped in if it's ever needed.
  * Now includes a versionnum file to ensure that versions of the file
    can be identified.
Admin:
  Tested with the supplied test file and a number of real
  well-formed files.
