log
@  NVRAM tags checker code updated to support indirected tags.
Detail:
  * Indirected tag checking support added to identify tags which refer to
    tags which don't exist or cyclic dependencies.
  * Initial work to allow Throwback to be dropped in if it's ever needed.
  * Now includes a versionnum file to ensure that versions of the file
    can be identified.
Admin:
  Tested with the supplied test file and a number of real
  well-formed files.

Version 0.02. Not tagged
