log
@  Added support for a default country to prevent non-UK Bethany boxes being
  set to UK on a hard reset.
Detail:
  Countries are now specified as the country name, not the RISC OS country code
  as previous versions.
  Fixed bug by where the NVRAM locations for DefaultTerritory and ModemCountry
  were swapped.  Also fixed bug regarding the NVRAM setting for
  DefaultTerritory.  When storing this, the value must be the RISC OS country
  code EOR 1.
Admin:
  Spec updated (included here in the Resources directory).  ECO number 4392.
  Software modifications tested on my Risc PC and on the Bethany hardware.

Version 0.51. Tagged as 'NVRAM-0_51'

@	Altered the MakeImage utility.

Detail:
	Now supports CSFS tags being available within the configuration file.
To compile this functionality in, then compile the code with the SUPPORT_CSFS
preprocessor flag set.
	Altered the DefaultCountry and ModemCountry tags so that their types
are now correct. This will stop a potential bug from occuring.
	Tags are now written into the BootBlock area if they have a TagType
greater than zero. This allows us to disperse the tags in the internal
big_list in a more sane manner.
 	Also added an example config file for CSFS support.

Admin:
	Tested.
	Please note that if giving this code to outside customers for the
Customer A-based projects they must not get any of the SUPPORT_CSFS-enabled code.
Plase strip this out if sending the code outside the company.
