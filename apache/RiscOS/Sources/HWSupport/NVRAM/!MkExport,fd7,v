1.1
log
@    Various little improvements.

Detail:
    Reordered the makefile slightly.
    There is now a Docs directory, in which is a file that contains detail of
the five SWIs that were added to version 0.48 of this module. This
information was not available elsewhere and needs to go into the FS sometime.
    Replace the Mk... obey files with !Mk... files.
    The header files now include the five new SWI definitions.

Admin:
    Untested.

Version 0.55. Tagged as 'NVRAM-0_55'
