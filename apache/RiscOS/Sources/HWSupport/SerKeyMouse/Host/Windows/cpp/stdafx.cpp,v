1.1
log
@  Added source for the Windows executable for the host side of the serial link
Detail:
  Alternative controllers for other OSes are under development, so to keep
  them together (and potentially keep synchronisation with protocol changes
  if there are any) I'm placing it inside the SerKeyMouse module sources,
  rather than scattering them in far-flung parts of the source tree depending
  upon which OS they run on.
Admin:
  Original code from Adrian Lees, packaged up into a more complete
  sub-component by Rob Sprowson. I have tweaked the location from which it
  reads the VersionNum file so that SerKeyMouse and serial.exe versions stay
  in step, but this change hasn't been tested.

Version 0.02. Tagged as 'SerKeyMouse-0_02'
