@Fix for nonsense error and implement a 'todo' action
An (unlikely) error during ScanBus would end up with an error block pointing to &00000004 as although the V bit was carefully preserved, R0 wasn't.
Add a RAM flag to remember if the module is operating in no-PCI-bus mode (for PCI_RAMAlloc and PCI_RAMFree) so that the bus access SWIs can return a meaningful error.

Resources/UK/Messages, Errors.s:
 New error message "NoPCIBus".
GetAll.s:
 Remove unnecessary header includes, and use {FALSE} and {TRUE}.
Module.s:
 Record result of OS_ReadSysInfo call to determine if there's a PCI bus or not.
 Do fail to initialise in the RAM loading case if ResourceFS register fails.
Scan.s:
 Preserve R0 if ScanBus returns an error.
 Add some comments.
Interface.s:
 Inspect flag and report error for those SWIs that are harmful when no bus exists, anything going via ValidateHandle doesn't need to since pci_handles will be 0 in that case.
 Relocate FindFreeHandle to Scan.s.

Tested briefly with and without the "got PCI" bit set, showing the appropriate error being returned.
