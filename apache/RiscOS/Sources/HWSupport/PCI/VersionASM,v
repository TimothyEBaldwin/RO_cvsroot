@Fix PCI_RAMAlloc to be physically aligned
Detail:
  Although PCI_RAMAlloc claims to allocate blocks at the given alignment, both of the two implementations available (OS_Heap 7 and non-OS_Heap 7) perform the alignment and boundary checks using the logical address of the block. Most of the time this seems to work (few clients need anything greater than 4K page alignment), but for those clients that do need greater alignment, this can easily lead to failure.
  s/Memory - Change PCI_RAMAlloc implementation so that it ensures the block of memory it uses is aligned in both logical and physical spaces. Really it's only the physical alignment we care about, but for now the easiest/safest fix is to match the alignment and stick with the current logically-aligned allocation routines.
  s/GetAll, s/Interface, s/Memory - Use definitions from Hdr:OSMem where appropriate
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 3
  SMP module is now able to correctly get a 16K-aligned block for use as L1PT
  Note that skipping the first few pages of the area recommended by OS_Memory 12 does introduce the risk of non-aligned/non-contiguous areas being returned once the DA becomes close to full. But, for the case where the desired 32MB physically aligned block isn't available and we fall back to smaller block sizes, there's always been the danger that we'll start returning invalid blocks to the client (whether due to the client asking for an alignment we can't satisfy, or the DA exceeding the limits of the aligned area OS_Memory suggested to us)

@Implement missing memory attribute support for PCI_HardwareAddress & PCI_LogicalAddress
Detail:
  s/Interface - Now that OS_Memory 13 allows the cache policy to be specified, PCI_HardwareAddress & PCI_LogicalAddress (which have always been documented as allowing the policy to be specified) can have support for it implemented. PCI_LogicalAddres now also has support for specifying the cacheability implemented (was also documented but unimplemented).

@Make PCI_MemoryWrite more useful
Previously the behaviour was thus

MemoryRead
  for (i = 0; i < wordcount; i++)
    buffer[i] = *pcimem
MemoryWrite
  for (i = 0; i < wordcount; i++)
    pcimem[i] = *buffer

so in the write case the buffer was largely redundant and the SWI would data abort when copying > 1MB as it fell outside the temporary IO assignment from OS_Memory 14. Now it does

MemoryWrite
  for (i = 0; i < wordcount; i++)
    *pcimem = buffer[i]

the most common case where wordcount = 1 is unchanged, and MemoryRead is unchanged.
Also
 - sprinkle in some more comments
 - make use of mem_to_phys_offset that the HAL is kind enough to have given us, even if it is 0
 - update the capability id bits from PCI-SIG ECN from April 2010

Tested with a parallel port PCI card, which reported it had vendor specific capabilities (InfCap09).

@Fix for nonsense error and implement a 'todo' action
An (unlikely) error during ScanBus would end up with an error block pointing to &00000004 as although the V bit was carefully preserved, R0 wasn't.
Add a RAM flag to remember if the module is operating in no-PCI-bus mode (for PCI_RAMAlloc and PCI_RAMFree) so that the bus access SWIs can return a meaningful error.

Resources/UK/Messages, Errors.s:
 New error message "NoPCIBus".
GetAll.s:
 Remove unnecessary header includes, and use {FALSE} and {TRUE}.
Module.s:
 Record result of OS_ReadSysInfo call to determine if there's a PCI bus or not.
 Do fail to initialise in the RAM loading case if ResourceFS register fails.
Scan.s:
 Preserve R0 if ScanBus returns an error.
 Add some comments.
Interface.s:
 Inspect flag and report error for those SWIs that are harmful when no bus exists, anything going via ValidateHandle doesn't need to since pci_handles will be 0 in that case.
 Relocate FindFreeHandle to Scan.s.

Tested briefly with and without the "got PCI" bit set, showing the appropriate error being returned.

@Fix PCI dynamic area growth logic
Detail:
  s/Memory - Fixed a couple of bugs in the dynamic area growth logic that could cause it to fail in some situations:
  * If a boundary value was specified, an invalid boundary value was being passed to OS_Heap when the operation was retried, causing the op to fail
  * The heap grow code was enforcing a minimum alignment of 8 bytes as a way of trying to ensure there'd be enough space for a used block header. However this won't work if the alignment is greater than 4 to begin with; it's much better to just add the extra 4 bytes onto r0 to begin with.
