4.2
log
@	Changed the component to use srccommit.
Detail:
	This component would not build with the latest version of RemoteDB as
the names used have been changed. Have used this opportunity to alter the
component to use DebugLib. There have been no functionality changes.
	Default output mechanism is to zip disc.
	Altered the makefile to use Stripdepend.
Admin:
	Tested as a softload on a Funai 4 build and actually in a Funai 4
build.
