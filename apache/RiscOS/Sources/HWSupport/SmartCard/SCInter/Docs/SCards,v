@Smartcard OS
============

Commands
--------
A command sent to a smartcard consists of at least five bytes, with optional
data bytes following. A command consists of:

   CLA        1 byte    The CLASS byte
   INS        1 byte    The INSTRUCTION byte
   P1         1 byte    control PARAMETER
   P2         1 byte    control PARAMETER
   Lc or P3   1 byte    length of following data or length of response data
   data       n bytes   optional data

A command is always followed by a response from the smartcard. This consists
of optional data, followed by a two byte return code:

   data       n bytes   optional response data
   SW1        1 byte    response code byte 1
   SW2        1 byte    response code byte 2

Different manufacturers cards do not necessarily use the same Class and
Instruction codes for the same instructions.

Reset
-----
On reset, a smartcard sends a stream of bytes known as the Answer To Reset
(ATR). This consists of data about what the card supports (in terms of
baud rate etc.), along with a 'historical' component which can be defined
by an manufacturer or supplier. Acorn has defined a format for the historical
data which provides information on card manufacturer, card OS etc. and this
data is used by SCInterface to determine what commands to send to the card.
