@  Update FPEmulator binary component to support IOMD-class machines.
Detail:
  We're still waiting for clearance for ARM to release the sources to
  FPEmulator/FPASC. The sources can build many different variants depending
  upon which target machine(s) are required and which OS facilities are
  available, but for now we're bodging this binary-only release to support
  two pre-built binaries (rather than the Tungsten-only build previously
  offered). These are:
  * M-variant, suitable for machines with or without hardware FPA, and where
    only ARMv3 instructions are used
  * CELM-variant, suitable only for machines without hardware FPA, and using
    ARMv4 and ARMv5 instructions
  Both variants assume they are running on an Ursula kernel or later.
Admin:
  Not tested, but should be a low-risk change.

Version 4.27. Tagged as 'FPASC-4_27'

@Import of BBE versions of certain components.
This is the result of executing the BBE build phase on a complete Tungsten
ROM build. It may be linked into any other compatible ROM builds in the same
way as if the source was available, but obviously it cannot be studied or
improved upon in its current form, and it is not portable to any incompatible
architecture variants or ABIs.
It is hoped that in future this will be replaced by a full source release.
