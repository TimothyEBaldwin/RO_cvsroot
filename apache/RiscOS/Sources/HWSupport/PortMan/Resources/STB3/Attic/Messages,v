@Summary
    Fixed Makefile and Resources and added support for STB22.

Detail
    Makefile was trying to get Messages file from Resources.<Locale>, but they
    were in Resources.<Machine> - added Resources.<Locale> and moved Messages
    in there.

    Changed to use LocalRes$Path for Messages.

    Added Resources.Peregrine and copied STB3 tags in there, to support STB22
    (as far as I know, it's the same, and what we've been using so far...).

    Added install phase to Makefile to support Expansion card builds.
Admin
    Built as part of ATM25 Expansion card build for Peregrine (STB22).
