log
@  Changes for RISC OS 5.
Detail:
  * Merged in RISCOS Ltd change: module no longer fails to intialise if no
    CDROMs are configured. This, along with their equivalent change in
    CDFS, allows the number of CDROMs to be configured up from 0 from the
    command line
  * Moved resources here from CDFSResources - allows tokenisation
  * Uses objasm and shared makefiles
  * 32-bit compatible
Admin:
  Not tested.
