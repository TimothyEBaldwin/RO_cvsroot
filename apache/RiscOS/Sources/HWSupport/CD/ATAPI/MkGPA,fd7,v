4.1
log
@Now responds to "Driver in use" errors returned from ADFS_ATAPIOp by
retrying up to the specified timeout (or 10 seconds for internally generated
SCSI_Ops). If the timeout is reached, the CD_SCSIUserOp entry point will
return a SCSI-compatible "ATAPI driver reservation error" error pointer;
other entry points pass "Driver in use" through unchanged.
Also added GPA generation capability, for what it's worth.
