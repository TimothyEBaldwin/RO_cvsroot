@Fix drive lock status reporting for empty drives
Detail:
  s/DriverCode - Change IsDrawerLocked handler to read the lock status from the drive via mode page &2A, rather than doing a completely unrelated TEST UNIT READY command. On the offchance that &2A isn't implemented, just fall back on our softcopy of the lock state, which is effectively what TEST UNIT READY was doing in the first place.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix
  CD_IsDrawerLocked now returns a sensible value for empty drives, instead of a drive empty error
  Fixes issue reported on forums where CDFS iconbar menu doesn't allow empty drives to be ejected (for ATAPI, at least):

@Go straight to READ(12) rather than using READ CD emulation on new ATAPI drives
In the central data transfer step (DriverCode.s around line 450) there are up to 3 goes at doing the transfer, attempting to work around some problems in <unspecified model> Sony drive and Panasonic CD-571B. Others may be affected similarly.
However, the very latest combined DVD/CD reader, eg. SATA attached SH-224DB/BEBE, have given up entirely with READ CD. In particular, they do not error it, nor are any bytes transferred to the buffer. This falls foul of CDFSSoftATAPI's 3 step approach, because the absence of an error is taken as success and the (junk RMA) block passed up to CDFS.
Unfortunately because the model of Sony reader is not mentioned in the sources nor CVS history we can't do a string match on the model name.
Instead, we now look at the reply to IDENTIFY and look for any declaring ATAPI-5 or later. ATAPI-5 was released in 2000, which definitely post dates the workaround by 4 or 5 years.
hdr/IDEdefs: declare offset for IDENTIFY to the version fields.
Module.s: hook out the version (being careful that pre ATAPI-4 don't have this field). Make a note in the DriveFlag if READ(12) is suspect vintage.
Variables.s: reintroduce the DriveFlag in the HAL case
DriverCode.s: free up a register to load DriveFlag into, look at the DriveFlag, skip straight to READ(12) on ATAPI-5 or later.

Tested on Titanium.
Fixes bogus "CDFS does not support that type of disc" with a simple ISO9660 formatted DVD, due to an untouched RMA block being parsed by CDFS.

@Try a 3rd time to ReadData from a drive
The ReadData function already has 2 workarounds for some quirks with Sony and Panasonic drives, using READ_CD to emulate the behaviour of READ_DATA because the latter didn't work on the particular models Acorn shipped. However, with DVD drives some firmware vendors have been a bit literal about what READ_CD does, so you end up in a situation of being able to read a CD but not a DVD in an otherwise identical setup.
Change the retry loop from 2 goes to 3. On the 3rd attempt just try using READ_DATA(12) like the standard intended, so we retain the former workarounds and only use that command last. Note that READ_DATA(2) only has a 2 byte block count which would be a truncation from READ_CD's 3, so using READ_DATA(12) with a 4 byte block count keeps the command block shuffling simpler.
Tested on a HP branded TS-H653 and Pioneer DVR-TD11RS with an ISO9660 DVD-R.

@Fix for spurious error message mounting DVDs
When CDFS wants to change the drive's data mode to mount a DVD it does so via CD_SetParameters. As a side effect of that call, the read retry count is written too.
Some drives return illegal request errors when trying to set the read retry count (even though they're marked as changeable), so just swallow the error like CDFSSoftSCSI does (driver.c revision 1.4 line 566).
Fixes "Compact disc is faulty" error with Samsung SH-S223B drive - the error message was spurious as it's just the default the error handler assumes when it can't look up error 0x50.

@  Support newer ARMs better
Detail:
  A couple of the routines relied on pre-ARMv6 style LDM functionality, and
  would abort on ARMv7+ (or ARMv6 in ARMv7 mode, if we ever get an ARMv6
  platform with ATAPI). Also took the opportunity to replace a lot of byte
  swizzling code fragments with REV instructions if only targeting ARMv6 or
  later. Bit of a shame they weren't macroised considering how many times
  they were used...

Detail:
  The physical ID by which ATA and ATAPI drives are address has been expanded

  drives, and scans the first 4 physical IDs returned by SWI ATA_Enumerate
  (falling back to the 4 legacy physical IDs if the SWI isn't found). This
  will fail on boards with more than 4 physical SATA ports, but caters for
  all current hardware. Also sneaked in the use of LDRH in the SWI dispatcher.

  * Internal disc number wasn't being shifted left by 15 bits before being

  * TARGETERROR error numbers weren't being correctly constructed in

1.3
log
@  Changed some odd version tracking code
Detail:
  This module had sets of defines for what options to have in what
   version of the module, instead of just using different versions out
   of a source control system...very odd.  Changed code to say
   "if version is over 1.24, use these standard flags".  Also removed
   check for a "too high" version number.
Admin:
  Built.
