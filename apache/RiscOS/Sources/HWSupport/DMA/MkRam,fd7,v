1.1.2.1
log
@  An intermediate version.
Detail:
  Finally, all IOMD dependencies have been expunged, and the module will
  build again. Any specific support for new features of other DMA controllers
  has yet to be added, though. New exported header added, for use by DMA
  device code.
Admin:
  Untested. However, should theoretically work if someone were to write the
  appropriate routines for the IOMD HAL.
