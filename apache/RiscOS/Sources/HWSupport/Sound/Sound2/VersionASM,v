@Cope with SoundDMA being reinitialised
Detail:
  s/Sound2 - Adapt service call handler so that on Service_SoundLevel0Alive we reregister ourselves as the sound channel handler
Admin:
  Tested on iMX6
  This means that (combined with Sound1-1_42) *RMReinit of SoundDMA while Maestro is playing music will not halt playback (However, Maestro won't spot that playback has been switched from 8 channels back to the default of 1 channel)

@Automatically adjust tempo for current sample rate + DMA buffer size
Detail:
  The Sound_QTempo SWI has always been defined as accepting a tempo value that's relative to the number of beats per centisecond.
  However the implementation has never attempted to adjust the value to match the current sound system settings; it's always worked under the assumption that one buffer = one centisecond.
  For default sound settings on an Archimedes this would have been almost correct, but for modern machines with different sample rates or buffer sizes it's generally wrong.
  This change rectifies that, by taking whatever tempo value was supplied to the SWI and adjusting it behind the scenes so that the core scheduling code uses the correct beat increment.
  For compatibility with existing software which may be relying on the fact that tempo was never dealt with correctly, this new behaviour can be disabled and the old behaviour used instead simply by disabling automatic tuning via Sound_Tuning.
  s/Sound2 - As above. Added RecalcTempo routine which is responsible for relculating the internal tempo value whenever the external value changes or the sound system configuration changes. This is called from SoundQTempo whenever the user-facing tempo value changes, and from the service call handler whenever the sound system configuration changes or when automatic tuning is turned on or off.

  Tested on BB-xM
  !Maestro now plays music at the correct speed when switching the sound system through different sample rates
  This goes part way towards fixing issue #347; fixes for the voice generators are still required:

Detail:
  s/Sound2 - Instead of assembling to a 26/32bit neutral module, 26bit or 32bit code sequences will now be stripped out where possible, reaping almost insignificant rewards in terms of ROM space and performance.
