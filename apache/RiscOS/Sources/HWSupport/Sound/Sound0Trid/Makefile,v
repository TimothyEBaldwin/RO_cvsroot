@  Build change
Detail:
  CPU version is no longer specified in the makefile - it's better to inherit
  it from the build environment now that we actually set it appropriately.
Admin:
  Built but not tested. Binary should be unchanged - this only affects the
  warnings generated during assembly.

1.2
log
@Delegates control of the codec (especially the mixer part thereof) to the
SoundControl module. As an aide to this, has some minimal support for a
HALised audio controller system. To this end, now exports a header file
describing such devies - required to build today's HAL.
