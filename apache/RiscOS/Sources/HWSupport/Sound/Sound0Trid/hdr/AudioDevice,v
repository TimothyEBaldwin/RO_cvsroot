1.1
log
@Delegates control of the codec (especially the mixer part thereof) to the
SoundControl module. As an aide to this, has some minimal support for a
HALised audio controller system. To this end, now exports a header file
describing such devies - required to build today's HAL.

Version 1.64. Tagged as 'Sound0Trid-1_64'
