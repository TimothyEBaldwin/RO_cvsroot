1.1.2.1
log
@A version of SoundDMA that will work on the Alba 2 board, using FIQs for
buffer handover so it works on revision B parts.
No attempt at any sort of HAL interface, or use of the DMA manager, but it's
good enough for Alba 2.
Except if anyone ones to try anything like software IR reception, they'll
have to figure out how to integrate this FIQ handler into theirs.

Version 1.62, 4.8.2.1. Tagged as 'Sound0-1_62-4_8_2_1'
