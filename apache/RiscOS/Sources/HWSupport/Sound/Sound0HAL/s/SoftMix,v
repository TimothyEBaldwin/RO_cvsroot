log
@Add device enumeration and selection APIs. Make audio HAL device API more flexible. Add a generic software mixer implementation that can be used for devices where no hardware mixer is available.
Detail:
  Makefile - Include new source files. Export a C version of hdr/Sound.
  Resources/* - Add new error text to messages file and update command help text
  Version - Update MaxDeviceVersion. Add MinDeviceVersion definition to get rid of a magic constant from the code. Add new switch for whether software mixer support is enabled.
  hdr/AudioDevice - Extend with audio device API 3 features. Buffer size granularity can now be non-power of 2 values, and CustomDMA can be used in a synchronous manner instead of an asynchronous manner (asynchronous defers buffer filling to an RTSupport routine, synchronous performs it directly from within the callback from the device). Also correct a comment relating to AudioRateTable_Frequency.
  hdr/Sound - Add new SWIs and reason codes. Protect a portion of the header from being processed by Hdr2H (Hdr2H can't handle it)
  s/Sound0 - Change default sample rate & buffer size settings to 22050Hz (none of the hardware currently supported by this version of the module supports 20833Hz). Add implementations of the new SWIs and features. Tidy up a couple of other bits.
  s/Sound0NEON - Refactor post-processing code to add support for the software mixer - code is now generated by macros rather than copy & paste. Fix indentation of some other code sections.
  s/DeviceList - New file to contain code related to managing the list of audio devices that SoundDMA now keeps.
  s/SoftMix - New file containing the software mixer device implementation. Implements a single mixer channel to control the overall gain of the sound system. Mixing/volume scaling is performed by the buffer post-processing sequences in Sound0ARM/Sound0NEON, with the optimisation of skipping the processing for a gain of +0dB. Note however that Sound0ARM has yet to be updated and so software mixing is currently only available for the NEON version of the module.
Admin:
  Tested in iMX6 ROM
  German resources are in need of translation
