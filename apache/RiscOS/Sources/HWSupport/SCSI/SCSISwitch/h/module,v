log
@Add missing timeout functionality. Avoid issuing INQUIRY commands with 5 bytes of response data. Rewrite makefile and tidy code a bit.
Detail:
  Makefile - Rewritten to use makefile fragments
  !MkDebug,fd7 - Added script to build softloadable debug version
  c/svcprint - Removed obsolete file
  c/cmodule, c/scsi, h/module, h/scsiswitch - Fixed compiler warnings. Implemented missing timeout functionality for drivers which support background transfers. Use Portable_Idle within the foreground-as-background loop to avoid the CPU spinning in a loop so much. Avoid race conditions if a transfer completes at the same time as an escape/timeout event.
  c/scsi - SCSI_Initialise 2 (determine device) now issues a 36 byte inquiry instead of a 5 byte one. This avoids an issue where some dodgy SCSI devices don't respond properly (or at all) to 5-byte inquiries.
Admin:
  Tested in softload on Iyonix

1.1
log
@* New SCSIdriver replacement that acts as a dispatcher to multiple hardware
  drivers (eg SCSI cards, USB mass storage devices, ATAPI devices...).
* Not totally complete, but functioning sufficiently for SCSIFS.
* Requires a new C compiler (newer than one in CVS at time of check-in) due
  to a couple of compiler crashes - if it builds, you're compiler is new
  enough.
