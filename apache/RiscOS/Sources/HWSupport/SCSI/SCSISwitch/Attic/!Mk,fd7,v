@Report something other than 'unknown' for capacity in *DEVICES
Appears to be accidentally commented out since 2.05, both determinedevice() and scsi_determine_device() now follow the same logic. Previously no capacity SCSI op was made, hence -1 -1 translated to 'unknown'.
Makefile simplified based on more recent CModule fragment additions.
CMHG file lined up nicely!

Tested briefly on BBxM over USB, and on Acorn AKA31 podule.

1.1
log
@* New SCSIdriver replacement that acts as a dispatcher to multiple hardware
  drivers (eg SCSI cards, USB mass storage devices, ATAPI devices...).
* Not totally complete, but functioning sufficiently for SCSIFS.
* Requires a new C compiler (newer than one in CVS at time of check-in) due
  to a couple of compiler crashes - if it builds, you're compiler is new
  enough.
