1.1
log
@Report something other than 'unknown' for capacity in *DEVICES
Appears to be accidentally commented out since 2.05, both determinedevice() and scsi_determine_device() now follow the same logic. Previously no capacity SCSI op was made, hence -1 -1 translated to 'unknown'.
Makefile simplified based on more recent CModule fragment additions.
CMHG file lined up nicely!

Tested briefly on BBxM over USB, and on Acorn AKA31 podule.

Version 2.10. Tagged as 'SCSISwitch-2_10'
