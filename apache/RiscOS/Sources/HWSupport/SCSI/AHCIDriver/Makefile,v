@Build fix
Detail:
  The exports phase failed exporting a C version of AHCIDevice. Since nothing depends on it, skip exporting it.

# CModule is equally useful for assembler modules. Its advantages over the
# AAmModule makefile are that you can use multiple source files (permitting
# more encapsulation, which is good programing practice) and it allows you
# to use non-postion-independent code, provided you do BL __RelocCode early
# in module initialisation.
