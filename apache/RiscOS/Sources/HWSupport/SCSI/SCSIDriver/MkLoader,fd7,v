@Update SCSI podule driver for more recent SCSI switchers
The SCSISoftWD33C93 driver was used as a test bed for the SCSI switcher, but a typo in the supported features mask meant that it didn't work any longer after SCSI switch 2.01 (version 2.00 didn't check the features mask, hence it worked).
Makefile
* Can now produce either SCSILog or standalone SCSIDriver or SCSISoft module, based on the TARGET and/or COMPONENT
SCSIEquates
* Shuffle some common equates around so the same header can be used with SCSILog and SCSIDriver
SCSIMacros
* A cut and paste fumble meant the DisableIRQs macro actually left them enabled
* Lined up
SCSIDriver
* Changed to accept podule numbers 0-7 for Risc PC (was 0-3)
* Get the base address from Podule manager rather than IOC era logical addresses
* Chopped out some long redundant switches
* Use PSR manipulation macros to allow 26 or 26/32 or 32 bit compatible variants
* Fix typo in features mask to &22 (was &21)
* Use PLP after PHPSEI rather than RestPSR, the preserve value from PHPSEI is not guaranteed RestPSR compatible
* Don't re-register a second time on Service_Reset, this is not needed in the loaded-from-ROM; loaded-from-disc; or reinit cases (since the module initialisation already registers), and don't wipe the workspace when a client to SCSI switcher (it get's very confused as transactions are in play)
SCSILog
* Delete defines now taken from SCSIEquates
* Get the base address from Podule manager rather than IOC era logical addresses
* Changed to accept podule numbers 0-7 for Risc PC (was 0-3)

Requires HdrSrc-2_32
Tested on AKA31 podule, on a StrongARM RISC OS 3.70, and a StrongARM RISC OS 5.20, in both SCSISoftWD33C93 and SCSIDriver configurations connected to a CD-ROM drive and harddisc, copying the contents of a random CD onto the harddisc.

Version 1.18. Tagged as 'SCSIDriver-1_18'
