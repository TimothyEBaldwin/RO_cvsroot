@Make Portable_Idle perform a DSB before the WFI, and use the CP15 WFI op on ARMv6. Allow the CPU clock device to vanish and re-appear. Export a C version of the CPUClkDevice header.
Detail:
  s/Front, s/GetAll, s/StPortable - Improve Portable_Idle implementation so that it issues a DSB before the WFI, and uses the CP15 WFI (potentially with erratum 486865 workaround) for ARMv6. Adjust handling of CPU clock device in order to allow it to be registered and deregistered at runtime.
  Makefile, h/CPUClkDevice - Export a C version of the CPUClkDevice header
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1B/2B/3B

log
@Add initial implementation of the new HAL friendly BMU interface
Detail:
  hdr/BMUDevice - New header describing layout of BMU HAL devices
  Makefile - export hdr/BMUDevice, and a C version of hdr/Portable
  hdr/Portable - Lots of new definitions related to the BMU interface. VirtualRPC BMU vars renamed slightly to match the A4/HAL naming convention (PortableBMUV_) instead of the Stork naming convention (Portable_BMUVar_).
  s/Front, s/GetAll, s/StPortable - BMU interface implementation. Two new SWIs (Portable_EnumerateBMU & Portable_ReadBMUVariables) are provided, along with a semi backwards compatible Portable_ReadBMUVariable implementation. Code also updated to use OSHW_ constants instead of magic numbers.
  Resources/UK/Messages - New error message text added
Admin:
  Tested in ROM on BB-xM, Pandora, TouchBook

log
@Add code for controlling CPU speed via interacting with a CPUClk HAL device.
Detail:
  Makefile, hdr/CPUClkDevice - Add HALDevice_CPUClk descriptor to header exports
  hdr/Portable - Trim some obsolete definitions, tidy formatting, add Speed2 and (unimplemented) WakeTime SWI numbers, add BatteryTimeRemaining and MaxBatteryTime BMU variables (from VirtualRPC)
  s/Front, s/GetAll, s/StPortable - Added Portable_Speed and Portable_Speed2 implementations, for controlling CPU speed. Portable_Speed is fully compatible with the old A4 version; all new features are exposed via Portable_Speed2 instead. Also added some debug-only stats logging code to track how much time is spent in various states.
  Resources/UK/Messages - New error messages.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 BB, A2 BB-xM, C1 TouchBook.
  Portable_Speed2 & HALDevice_CPUClk documentation will be on the wiki soon.

log
@Add initial version of PortableHAL, bare-bones 32bit-safe Portable module
Detail:
  Currently only supporte the Portable_Idle and Portable_Features SWIs.
  Portable_Idle is implemented using the WFI instruction found in ARMv6K+, but the module should compile and run on any architecture.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard
