@Japanese year system
====================
This territory provides three special time format strings specific to Japan
for the Japanese era system.

These are:

      %JE     Japanese era name in full (maximum length 12 bytes)
      %J1     Abbreviation for Japanese era name (maximum length 2 bytes)
      %JY     Year number within the era (maximum length 3 bytes)

As you can't use Territory_ReadCalendarInformation to find the maximum
length of these strings, users should assume the lengths listed here.

Eras may be added to the messages file straightforwardly. JEx is the %J1
string, JExL is the %JE string, and %JSx is the start date for the era.
This must be in the format "%W3, %DY-%M3-%CE%YR", in Japanese. (Bizarre,
I know, but that's how ConvertTimeStringToOrdinals likes it).
Eras start at noon on the day stated.

Sorting etc
===========
Because the alphabet for this territory is UTF8, a lot of character
property tables don't make sense. A new interface will have to be
defined for this to work properly (ISO are working on this
apparently).

Collation order is as per the UK territory for the Basic Latin set
(00-7F), and any multibyte UTF characters will be sorted into
UCS order.
