1.2
log
@  Updated build structure to use the shared AAsmModule makefile.
  BBE no longer needs to export all the sources.
  Fixed some non-32bit compatible code.
Detail:
  srcbuild has been updated to be able to process components which want
    to contribute multiple targets to a build.  This means that it is
    no longer necessary to export the entire sources for this component
    into BBE builds.
  There were still a few LDM {..pc}^ instructions around - these have been
    fixed.
Admin:
  Requires Library 0.71 or later.
  Requires BuildSys 3.08 or later.
  Requires Env 0.65 or later.
  Requires srcbuild 0.31 if you need to generate a BBE from this component.
