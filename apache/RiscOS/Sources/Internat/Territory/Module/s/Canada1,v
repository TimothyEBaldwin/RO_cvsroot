@Add ability to programmatically enumerate available timezones within a territory.
Reduced GBLL flag proliferation by using a WHILE/WEND loop to generate the code in Territory_ReadTimeZones.
Moved the standard date and time format strings into 'DateTime.s'.
No longer returns untrappable error numbers of 0, nor unallocated error numbers.
Alaska now recognised as part of the USA following its incorporation in 1912.
Obsolete Yukon timezone removed from Canada.

SWI Territory_ReadTimeZones (&4304A)
------------------------------------
=> R0 bits 0-9 territory number
      bits 10-26 reserved, must be zero
      bits 27-31 timezone within territory
   or -1 to use the current territory (ie. as though bits 10-31 zero)
<= R0 = name of standard time
   R1 = name of summer time
   R2 = signed offset of standard time from UTC in cs
   R3 = signed offset of summer time from UTC in cs

; Thus strings are first sorted by letters, then accents, then case, in

; If you want an accented letter to be sorted as a letter in its own right,
; such as n-tilde in Spanish, then ToPlain(n-tilde) should = n-tilde.
; If this isn't acceptable, then define a separate ToPlainForCollate table -
; this might be necessary for funny sorting of u-diaeresis with y in
; Scandinavian territories: ToPlain(u-diaerisis)=u, ToPlainForCollate(u-diaeresis)=y.
;
; fi and fl ligatures are specially treated to sort equal to separate fi
; and fl.
;
; In French, accents are sorted backwards - accent differences at
; the end of a word are more important than accent differences at the start. For

@Added Turkish, Italian and German territories. The Turkish and Italian are
still unfinished, and probably totally wrong, but at least they're there and
will build.

Also, a minor collation fix for Thorn=TH, and currency of France changed to
the Euro.
