log
@Add ability to programmatically enumerate available timezones within a territory.
Reduced GBLL flag proliferation by using a WHILE/WEND loop to generate the code in Territory_ReadTimeZones.
Moved the standard date and time format strings into 'DateTime.s'.
No longer returns untrappable error numbers of 0, nor unallocated error numbers.
Alaska now recognised as part of the USA following its incorporation in 1912.
Obsolete Yukon timezone removed from Canada.

SWI Territory_ReadTimeZones (&4304A)
------------------------------------
=> R0 bits 0-9 territory number
      bits 10-26 reserved, must be zero
      bits 27-31 timezone within territory
   or -1 to use the current territory (ie. as though bits 10-31 zero)
<= R0 = name of standard time
   R1 = name of summer time
   R2 = signed offset of standard time from UTC in cs
   R3 = signed offset of summer time from UTC in cs

; If you want an accented letter to be sorted as a letter in its own right,

; If this isn't acceptable, then define a separate ToPlainForCollate table -

@Fix Territory_ReadTimeZones to behave as documented.
It was reading the current timezone CMOS and returning that in R2 then adding the difference between standard and summertime to get R3.
This meant that when in one territory it was not possible to enumerate the other territories' offsets since they all returned the current CMOS value.
Now, R2 and R3 are purely informational (looked up from the table in the module).

All terrtories on CET now call summertime the preferred "CEST".

Removed unnecessary clean rule from Makefile. Changed some one register push/pull to use macros. Changed filenames to be ".s" at the end.

Added extra switches for the other regions of the world that are wide enough to span multiple timezones. Currently there is no API to read these, so they are defined to cause an assembly error (affects USA/Canada1/Australia). Fixing that is a subject of discussion, whether to support one territory having multiple timezones or just make some extra territories?

@Added Turkish, Italian and German territories. The Turkish and Italian are
still unfinished, and probably totally wrong, but at least they're there and
will build.

Also, a minor collation fix for Thorn=TH, and currency of France changed to
the Euro.
