@Addition of Iceland, Portugal & Netherlands Territory modules
Detail:
  Territory tables to general Icelandic, Portuguese and Netherlands territories using the shared territory module code.
Admin:
  Based on tables extracted from the original modules by Detlef Thielsch and Andreas Feldner, special thanks to them for releasing these under a BSD licence.
  Submission from Martin Avison, who reformatted the tables into a form compatible with the other territories.
  Tested on Iyonix with RISC OS v5.22 and v5.24, and RISC PC with RISC OS v4.39.

Version 0.62. Tagged as 'Module-0_62'
