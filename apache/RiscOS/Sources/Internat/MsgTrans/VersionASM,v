@Update MsgTrans's 'Item' macro to guard against menus which contain more items than their workspace definition suggests
Detail:
  hdr/MsgMenus - 'Item' macro now asserts if itemno > itemtot. This guards against situations where the space for a menu item within a module's workspace is smaller than the size of the menu (as was the case with bug #233)
Admin:
  Tested with clean builds of OMAP, Tungsten and IOMD ROMs - no errors encountered.
  Not tagged; this change shouldn't result in any change to compiler output (unless the assert fires!)

@  Backwards-compatibility fix.
Detail:
  MessageTrans_CloseFile will now not clear the file descriptor if the
  file was opened in a local memory block (R2 non-zero) with the old
  API (R3 not a magic value). This restores compatibility with some badly
  behaved applications (e.g. ARPlayer) that do lookups after closing a
  file. Also add a simple check to catch the use of invalid file descriptors
  (such as ones that have been closed), and add a new error message to be
  returned in this case.
  Minor change to MTransTest to help test the above.
Admin:
  Basic testing with MTransTest. Confirmed that ARPlayer now works.

4.15
log
@  Fix miscellaneous memory leaks and minor bugs.
Detail:
  - The module now frees (almost) all allocated memory on finalisation and
    can be reinitialised correctly. On finalisation, flg_addtolist is set in
    the flags of the client blocks of all files that had proxy blocks, and this
    causes the files to be reopened if they are used again. Note that any
    hash tables for files opened with the new API and R2 non-zero will be
    left allocated as the module cannot keep track of these. This works as
    everything remains valid, but if the format of the hash table is ever
    changed, and a new module is to be softloaded, the issue of identifying
    hash tables created by a previous version will need to be addressed.
  - When the module has been initialised it now immediately sends out a
    Service_MessageFileClosed. This is to warn that any direct pointers
    into data allocated by a previous MessageTrans are invalid.
  - Avoid calling OS_ServiceCall with r1=0 in our service call handler as
    this does nothing.
  - When MessageTrans_OpenFile was called on a file descriptor that was
    already open, allocated data (proxy, file and hash table) was leaked.
    Open files are now closed before being re-opened. Note that the error
    'Message file already open' will never be returned, though it has been
    left in the messages file for now.
  - All lines in message files can now be terminated by either NUL, CR or LF.
    This was the general rule previously, but there were some explicit
    checks for LF as the terminator of a token which have been removed.
  - The hashing code allowed '*' to be used as a wildcard in tokens in the
    message file, but this is not allowed in the specification or in the normal
    token matching code and so has been commented out.
  - Errors from EnsureFileIsOpen were incorrectly handled in internal_lookup.
  - Fix typo in skiptoken (compare to 32, not 3). This will make
    MessageTrans_MakeMenus behave as documented in allowing tokens in
    the menu block to be terminated by 0, 10 or 13 (rather than just 0).
  - Change HashTableAlloc to take descriptor pointer in R0 rather than R4.
    This avoids internal_lookup corrupting R4 when a hash table is recreated
    by a lookup occurring after a ResourceFS file changed. Previously
    the lookup would return junk when this happened.
  - MessageTrans_CloseFile now wipes the descriptor block so that
    MessageTrans_OpenFile won't get confused if the descriptor is re-used to
    open a different file. Check for null pointer to avoid killing the machine.
  - The fourth word of the 16-byte descriptor blocks was previously listed
    as spare but actually set to point to the filename. This is now required
    to allow file reopening on module reinitialisation to work.
  - Debugging improved. New 'debugswi' flag will print registers on entry to
    and exit from all the SWIs. New 'debughashalloc' flag allows hash table
    allocation debugging to be turned off.
Admin:
  - Service_ModulePostInit is used to trigger sending the initial
    Service_MessageFileClosed, so a kernel supporting this is required.
  - A new test program 'MTransTest' has been added. This allows testing
    of all combinations of file types and open methods.
  - Thoroughly tested with MTransTest as a debug module. Briefly tested in
    a ROM build. All seems well so far.

Detail:

@  Fixed an amusing stack imbalance in err_buffoverflow.
Detail:
  Any attempt to generate the "Buffer overflow" error message would fail
    due to the lookup routine pushing r1, r2 and lr - but only pulling pc.
  Errors from MessageTrans_EnumerateTokens are now trapped and cause
    building of the hash table to be aborted.  This stops other amusing
    aborts caused by ColourTrans using MessageTrans_OpenFile *PURELY*
    for the effect of getting the file unsqueezed for it.  ColourTrans
    is also disappointed by the private contents of the descriptor not
    matching what it thinks they are any more.  ColourTrans 1.70 and
    later now get things unsquashed via the official mechanism (it asks
    the Squash module ...)
Admin:
  Tested debug build - it no longer aborts if asked to open
   Resources:$.Resources.Colours.Tables.8desktop

@  New hashing facilities added to improve lookup times.
  Better debugging support added.
Detail:
  MessageTrans will construct hash tables for all the messages file that
    it thinks are worthwhile (>7 tokens, file is >80 bytes long).  API
    change documentation in Doc/HashingAPI.
  SVC stack tests now removed - proxy blocks are always used unless the
    caller used the new API (R3=FAST) and supplied a buffer in R2 on the
    call to MessageTrans_OpenFile.
  Test programs enhanced to not require the Palette messages file to be
    present - the Switcher messages are used instead.
  ShowMsgs test program now takes -c (show client blocks), -f (show flags
    as character strings) and <search substr> to restrict the output of
    the program to those blocks with filenames which contain the search
    substring.
  The old 16-byte client blocks contain the magic word, a flags word,
    pointer to the proxy block and a spare word.  Currently this spare
    word is filled in with a copy of the pointer to filename.  This is
    done for ShowMsgs benefit only - do not rely on this.  Similarly,
    the 7th word of the 32-byte blocks is used as a counter for the
    number of token lookups performed on that file - this is for testing
    only (to assess how much the hashing is helping) and must not be
    relied on either.
  MessageTrans no longer calls its own SWIs but uses BL to call them
    directly.  Saves SWI call overhead, plus makes the module standalone
    and the debug module tests are useful.
  Debug module capability added.  The debug module uses a different SWI
    name & number chunk and a different title to enable it to be loaded
    and tested without disrupting the rest of the machine.
  Messages re-organised so "Token not found" is the first in the file as
    this is the most commonly looked up message.
  Now built using objasm/link, instead of aasm.
Admin:
  Tested in Ursula ROM images for several weeks.  Test programs show
    data structures as expected.
  Requires link 5.15 (RiscOS/Library; tag Library-0_41 or later)

4.2.2.1
log
@  Hashing added.
  32-bit compatible.
Detail:
  MessageTrans will construct hash tables for message files in order
    to improve token lookup times.  Preliminary testing shows that
    lookup speeds can be up to 9 times faster in some cases. Primary
    beneficiaries of the hash strategy are FileSwitch, the Internet
    module and MessageTrans itself for the Global messages file.
    Cost is 264+4t bytes (where t = number of tokens in the file) and
    a minor performance penalty on the one-off construction of the
    hash table when the file is first opened.
  Test build capability added.  When the AltTitleAndSWI variable is
    set to true, the module builds with a different module name, SWI
    chunk name and SWI chunk number - thus allowing it to be softloaded
    on a machine and tested without interfering with the module which
    is controlling the rest of the system's message lookups.
Admin:
  Testing ongoing.  Test builds are running in desktop OS builds
    for an extended period of testing before this change is committed
    to the trunk.
