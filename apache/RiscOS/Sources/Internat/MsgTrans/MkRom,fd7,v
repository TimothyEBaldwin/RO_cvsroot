@  Fix miscellaneous memory leaks and minor bugs.
Detail:
  - The module now frees (almost) all allocated memory on finalisation and
    can be reinitialised correctly. On finalisation, flg_addtolist is set in
    the flags of the client blocks of all files that had proxy blocks, and this
    causes the files to be reopened if they are used again. Note that any
    hash tables for files opened with the new API and R2 non-zero will be
    left allocated as the module cannot keep track of these. This works as
    everything remains valid, but if the format of the hash table is ever
    changed, and a new module is to be softloaded, the issue of identifying
    hash tables created by a previous version will need to be addressed.
  - When the module has been initialised it now immediately sends out a
    Service_MessageFileClosed. This is to warn that any direct pointers
    into data allocated by a previous MessageTrans are invalid.
  - Avoid calling OS_ServiceCall with r1=0 in our service call handler as
    this does nothing.
  - When MessageTrans_OpenFile was called on a file descriptor that was
    already open, allocated data (proxy, file and hash table) was leaked.
    Open files are now closed before being re-opened. Note that the error
    'Message file already open' will never be returned, though it has been
    left in the messages file for now.
  - All lines in message files can now be terminated by either NUL, CR or LF.
    This was the general rule previously, but there were some explicit
    checks for LF as the terminator of a token which have been removed.
  - The hashing code allowed '*' to be used as a wildcard in tokens in the
    message file, but this is not allowed in the specification or in the normal
    token matching code and so has been commented out.
  - Errors from EnsureFileIsOpen were incorrectly handled in internal_lookup.
  - Fix typo in skiptoken (compare to 32, not 3). This will make
    MessageTrans_MakeMenus behave as documented in allowing tokens in
    the menu block to be terminated by 0, 10 or 13 (rather than just 0).
  - Change HashTableAlloc to take descriptor pointer in R0 rather than R4.
    This avoids internal_lookup corrupting R4 when a hash table is recreated
    by a lookup occurring after a ResourceFS file changed. Previously
    the lookup would return junk when this happened.
  - MessageTrans_CloseFile now wipes the descriptor block so that
    MessageTrans_OpenFile won't get confused if the descriptor is re-used to
    open a different file. Check for null pointer to avoid killing the machine.
  - The fourth word of the 16-byte descriptor blocks was previously listed
    as spare but actually set to point to the filename. This is now required
    to allow file reopening on module reinitialisation to work.
  - Debugging improved. New 'debugswi' flag will print registers on entry to
    and exit from all the SWIs. New 'debughashalloc' flag allows hash table
    allocation debugging to be turned off.
Admin:
  - Service_ModulePostInit is used to trigger sending the initial
    Service_MessageFileClosed, so a kernel supporting this is required.
  - A new test program 'MTransTest' has been added. This allows testing
    of all combinations of file types and open methods.
  - Thoroughly tested with MTransTest as a debug module. Briefly tested in
    a ROM build. All seems well so far.
