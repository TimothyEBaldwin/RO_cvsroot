@Build fix
Would fail to build with anything other than Keyboard=All since the Pandora key table is only included in that case, yet the code refers to it unconditionally.
Wrapped Pandora bits with Keyboard=All switch.
Tested briefly in an IOMD ROM with Keyboard=UK.

@Add support for the new 'wide' key handler format. Add support for keyboard types which have fundamentally different layouts to PC/Arc. Add a basic (UK) layout for the Pandora.
Detail:
  Doc/FileFormat, Doc/HandlerAPI - Updated docs with information about the new key handler format, and how to invoke it in layout files.
  c/keygen, c/unicdata, h/structures - Give keygen a bit of a tidy up. Add support for the new '$Type' directive to allow the keyboard type to be specified (to ensure correct intkey table is used, unique symbol names when the same country is supported by multiple keyboard types, etc.). Add support for the new key handler format.
  Sources/IntKeyBody, Sources/IntKeyMod, Sources/KeyStruct - Tidy up the code a bit to use key handler layout and key/OS_Byte numbers from Hdr:. Add support for the new key handler format, and for the new way keygen generates the layout files.
  layout/Pandora, Makefile, Sources/IntKeyBody, Sources/IntKeyMod, Sources/KeyStruct - Add a layout file for the Pandora, and modify IntKey to use different sets of layout files depending on the keyboard type.
Admin:
  New key handler format tested on Pandora. Old format tested on Pandora & BB-xM.
  Requires HdrSrc-2_20

@Added the files needed for building a keyboard driver for Finland.  Although
the layout for Finland is identical to that of Sweden, this addition has been
made for the sake of completeness.  It also allows a version of the module to
be built using "Finland" as the keyboard setting in the build environment.

The version number of the module has also been incremented to V0.40 to
flag the addition to the source code.

4.3.2.1
log
@Changed build structure and updated to InternationalKeyboard 0.41 / !IKHG 3.01
from trunk, thereby acquiring Windows 95 and Japanese key support, and made
further changes, viz:

Fixed lastreadkey bug in !IKHG, added NOP so Int'l Keyboard assembles cleanly.
Added Welsh alphabet and Wales2 country support.
Switched Wales into and Russia2 out of build.
In UK layout, moved bullet from Alt-Shift-8 to Alt-Shift-\.
In Wales layout, added Alt-T = TM, Alt-Shift-Z = single left angle-quote,
  and Alt-Shift-X = single right angle-quote.
Fixed !IKHG to call key D16 "End" instead of "Cpy".
Merged PC-delete code and Ursula service call table back in from Ursula branch.
Added PC-delete compatibility to !IKHG.
Added Alt-E shortcut for Euro symbol as follows:
  * No further action was required:
      Italy, Norway, Esperanto
  * oe/OE moved to Q:
      UK, Spain, France, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Belgium,
      Netherlands, Switzerland, USA
  * oe/OE moved to W:
      Germany, Iceland, LatinAm, Turkey
  * oe/OE moved to U:
      DvorakUK, DvorakUSA
  * e circumflex replaced with Euro:
      Wales, Wales2
DvorakLH and DvorakRH have not had a Euro shortcut added; Greece, Israel,
Russia and Russia2 don't have a Euro in their alphabets.
Comments on the above arrangements are welcome.

Reprocessed all handlers to encompass changes (including !IKHG.Layouts files).

@Bugfixes to increase consistency across handlers:

Belgium: added fi, fl, thorn, bullet, TM, SHY, Minus
DvorakUK: bullet moved to Alt-*
DvorakUSA: bullet moved to Alt-*
France: added TM, Yen, O slash; removed redundant sterling, currency and
  section duplicates; added bullet
Germany: added bullet, Minus, single guillemots (Ctrl-Alt), Euro (oops!)
Italy: added OE, TM, single guillemots, sexed quotes, Minus
LatinAm: replaced Alt-3 with sterling; added bullet
Netherlands: added fi, fl, eth, bullet, SHY, Minus; Alt-S is now German
  double s instead of section
Norway: added OE, TM
Spain: moved bullet to Alt-*
Switzerland: added fi, fl, TM; German double s available without Shift;
  added single guillemots (Ctrl-Alt)
Turkey: added TM, sexed quotes, single guillemots, bullet, perthousand
UK: moved bullet to Alt-*
USA: added masculine/feminine ordinals; added bullet at Alt-*
Wales: swapped " and @@; added OE, Minus, em- and en-dash; replaced E circumflex
  on Alt-E; added AE, Euro, fi, fl, O slash, Yen on Ctrl-Alt-A/E/I/L/O/Y

Also switched out Canada layout, because it does not appear to be up-to-date.

@Updated/added layout drawfiles for all Ursula layouts.

Alt-Delete now does nothing (matches behaviour before it was definable).

Added "dialling codes" for Wales (1222), Wales2 (2222), DvorakUK (9944)
and DvorakUSA (991).

!IKHG.Chars files now use quoted characters instead of codes. This requires
the alphabet to be correctly set before viewing, but makes visual
inspection more reliable.

Layout-specific changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Belgium/Denmark/France/Germany:
  Corrected double/single sexed quotes positions

Esperanto:
  Reintroduced into build, based upon trunk version, but without the
    characters that are absent from the Latin3 alphabet.

Greece:
  Added stress-diaeresis dead key on Alt-stress
  Removed Shift-B2 (undefined in Greek alphabet)

Israel:
  Removed inverted-!, inverted-? and Minus (not in Hebrew alphabet)
  Corrected multiply (in different place in Hebrew alphabet)
  Re-inserted divide in conventional position
  Added ASCII 0 on Ctrl-0
  Removed duplicate of Alt-0, Shift-Alt-R/S/Y
  Removed Ctrl versions of final pe (breaks Ctrl key convention)

LatinAm:
  Removed duplicate bar from Alt-1

Russia:
  Changed Ctrl combinations to follow the standard rules (Ctrl-0-9 works,
    any other Ctrl not in range @@,A-Z,[,\,],^,_ does nothing)

Switzerland:
  Removed duplicates of Alt-7/8/9, acute/tilde dead keys, [, ], {, }, \, dbl-s
  Ctrl-diaeresis now produces a dead accent, to match the other dead keys
  ASCII 28 now produced by Ctrl-\ instead of Ctrl-<
  Corrected double/single sexed quotes positions

Turkey:
  Added ASCII 0 combination on Ctrl-O-diaeresis
