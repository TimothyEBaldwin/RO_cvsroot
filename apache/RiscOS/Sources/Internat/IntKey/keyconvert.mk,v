@  Build fix
Detail:
  The build utilities keygen and keyconvert, compiled at build time, are now
  built using the HostTools shared makefile, and so will execute on any RISC OS
  build host even if the default compiler options are to target an incompatible
  ARM architecture. An attempt had already been made in this case to support a
  differing host architecture but the implementation was broken.
Admin:
  Tested using an APCS-R build on an Iyonix.
