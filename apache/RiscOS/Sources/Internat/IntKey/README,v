@Ursula branch merged.

Complete new keyboard definition system in terms of the UCS. See
Docs.FileFormat for information.
@
text
@!IKHG no longer works - create your layout files textually as described
in Doc.FileFormat.

The table in file KeyStruct must be modified to point to the tables which
your handler is to recognise (one entry for each country). For example,
the KeyStructureTable for Germany (in Germany.Source.KeyStruct) has entries
for UK (KeyStruct1), Germany (KeyStruct7) and Switzerland (KeyStruct35).
All others default to UK.

Finally, the IntKeyMod and Makefile files must be modified to pull
everything together.

@Rationalised structure - now builds a module containing either one
keyboard (+UK) or all keyboards, dependent on setting of <Keyboard>.

Added several new keyboards and improved existing ones.

Modernised !IKHG. In particular allowed editing of keypad, movement of Enter
backspace and shift, and allowed Caps Lock to work on characters obtained
using Alt.

Use !IKHG to create the assembler source for the keyboard handler tables. Do
this by pressing Escape when finished editing the layout. The generated
source file is saved in !IKHG.Source.<Keyboard>.

this by pressing Escape when finished editing the layout then press Escape
again when it asks if you want to create the module (it doesn't work). The
generated assembler file can be found in !IKHG.Source.GenSource (set the
file's type to Text).

Copy the generated assembler file into the appropriate place in the real
International Keyboard module sources and rename it as required eg.
UK.Source.UkPCKbd.

Now edit the generated assembler file, removing the KeyStructureTable as
this is now defined in a file called KeyStruct. The KeyStruct? table has
been extended so that key pad keys can also be modified so there must be two
more entries added to this table (see UK.Source.UkPCKbd for an example).
Mappings for the key pad must also be defined (see end of
UK.Source.UkPCKbd).

your handler is to recognise (one entry for each country, most will default
to UK - KeyStruct1). For example, the KeyStructureTable for Germany (in
Germany.Source.KeyStruct) has entries for Germany (KeyStruct7) and
Switzerland (KeyStruct35). All others default to UK.

4.1.4.1
log
@Changed build structure and updated to InternationalKeyboard 0.41 / !IKHG 3.01
from trunk, thereby acquiring Windows 95 and Japanese key support, and made
further changes, viz:

Fixed lastreadkey bug in !IKHG, added NOP so Int'l Keyboard assembles cleanly.
Added Welsh alphabet and Wales2 country support.
Switched Wales into and Russia2 out of build.
In UK layout, moved bullet from Alt-Shift-8 to Alt-Shift-\.
In Wales layout, added Alt-T = TM, Alt-Shift-Z = single left angle-quote,
  and Alt-Shift-X = single right angle-quote.
Fixed !IKHG to call key D16 "End" instead of "Cpy".
Merged PC-delete code and Ursula service call table back in from Ursula branch.
Added PC-delete compatibility to !IKHG.
Added Alt-E shortcut for Euro symbol as follows:
  * No further action was required:
      Italy, Norway, Esperanto
  * oe/OE moved to Q:
      UK, Spain, France, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Belgium,
      Netherlands, Switzerland, USA
  * oe/OE moved to W:
      Germany, Iceland, LatinAm, Turkey
  * oe/OE moved to U:
      DvorakUK, DvorakUSA
  * e circumflex replaced with Euro:
      Wales, Wales2
DvorakLH and DvorakRH have not had a Euro shortcut added; Greece, Israel,
Russia and Russia2 don't have a Euro in their alphabets.
Comments on the above arrangements are welcome.

Reprocessed all handlers to encompass changes (including !IKHG.Layouts files).
