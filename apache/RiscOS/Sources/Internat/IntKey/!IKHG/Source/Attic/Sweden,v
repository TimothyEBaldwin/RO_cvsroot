@%Include directive implemented in layout files - this gives a simpler

@Updated the layouts for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway to remove the

1.3.2.1
log
@Changed build structure and updated to InternationalKeyboard 0.41 / !IKHG 3.01
from trunk, thereby acquiring Windows 95 and Japanese key support, and made
further changes, viz:

Fixed lastreadkey bug in !IKHG, added NOP so Int'l Keyboard assembles cleanly.
Added Welsh alphabet and Wales2 country support.
Switched Wales into and Russia2 out of build.
In UK layout, moved bullet from Alt-Shift-8 to Alt-Shift-\.
In Wales layout, added Alt-T = TM, Alt-Shift-Z = single left angle-quote,
  and Alt-Shift-X = single right angle-quote.
Fixed !IKHG to call key D16 "End" instead of "Cpy".
Merged PC-delete code and Ursula service call table back in from Ursula branch.
Added PC-delete compatibility to !IKHG.
Added Alt-E shortcut for Euro symbol as follows:
  * No further action was required:
      Italy, Norway, Esperanto
  * oe/OE moved to Q:
      UK, Spain, France, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Belgium,
      Netherlands, Switzerland, USA
  * oe/OE moved to W:
      Germany, Iceland, LatinAm, Turkey
  * oe/OE moved to U:
      DvorakUK, DvorakUSA
  * e circumflex replaced with Euro:
      Wales, Wales2
DvorakLH and DvorakRH have not had a Euro shortcut added; Greece, Israel,
Russia and Russia2 don't have a Euro in their alphabets.
Comments on the above arrangements are welcome.

Reprocessed all handlers to encompass changes (including !IKHG.Layouts files).

@Rationalised structure - now builds a module containing either one
keyboard (+UK) or all keyboards, dependent on setting of <Keyboard>.

Added several new keyboards and improved existing ones.

Modernised !IKHG. In particular allowed editing of keypad, movement of Enter
backspace and shift, and allowed Caps Lock to work on characters obtained
using Alt.
