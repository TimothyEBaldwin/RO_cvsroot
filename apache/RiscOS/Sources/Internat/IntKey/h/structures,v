log
@Add support for the new 'wide' key handler format. Add support for keyboard types which have fundamentally different layouts to PC/Arc. Add a basic (UK) layout for the Pandora.
Detail:
  Doc/FileFormat, Doc/HandlerAPI - Updated docs with information about the new key handler format, and how to invoke it in layout files.
  c/keygen, c/unicdata, h/structures - Give keygen a bit of a tidy up. Add support for the new '$Type' directive to allow the keyboard type to be specified (to ensure correct intkey table is used, unique symbol names when the same country is supported by multiple keyboard types, etc.). Add support for the new key handler format.
  Sources/IntKeyBody, Sources/IntKeyMod, Sources/KeyStruct - Tidy up the code a bit to use key handler layout and key/OS_Byte numbers from Hdr:. Add support for the new key handler format, and for the new way keygen generates the layout files.
  layout/Pandora, Makefile, Sources/IntKeyBody, Sources/IntKeyMod, Sources/KeyStruct - Add a layout file for the Pandora, and modify IntKey to use different sets of layout files depending on the keyboard type.
Admin:
  New key handler format tested on Pandora. Old format tested on Pandora & BB-xM.
  Requires HdrSrc-2_20

@  Some bugfixes for keygen and keyconvert, discovered by gcc.
  Temporary GNUmakefile added containing UNIX build system.
Detail:
  gcc complained about returning the address of a local variable as
    a function result in both keygen and keyconvert.  The two variables
    concerned have now been made static like they should have been.
    Unlikely to have caused much aggravation, but only through luck.
  The Keyboard data structure has been updated to explicitly use an
    unsigned char in some places.  This is necessary for systems on
    which char is signed by default.
  The GNUmakefile is a temporary addition until native tool support can
    be sorted out.  In the xriscos environment, do "make links" and
    then "make rom" to build the module.  "make clean" will remove all
    the built stuff and the symbolic links.  Requires access to the
    exported Unicode library files.  keyconvert is built, but will not
    work for the obvious reason that it calls SWIs.
Admin:
  GNUmakefile will be removed at a later date - it's only temporary.
  Tested - builds the same module (for Keyboard=All, Machine=Phoebe)
    byte-identically.

@3rd party keys placed into UK, USA and Netherlands layouts - this is a temporary
measure until a proper build option is installed.
Dead key ring above + space now outputs U+00B0 (degree sign), rather than
U+02DB (ring above).
