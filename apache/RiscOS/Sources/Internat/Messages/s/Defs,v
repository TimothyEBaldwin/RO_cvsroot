4.1
log
@  Changes to support BBE more cleanly.
Detail:
  The included header files are included only in a standard build.  In the
    BBE, the definitions for the 3 SWIs it uses are provided explicitly.
    This means that nearly all of the assembler headers can be removed
    from the BBE.  This is useful because those headers contain many
    details about different customers' hardware and software which other
    customers (of the BBE) should not see.  Hdr:Machine.Machine is the
    only file that may need to be modified in this respect.
  During BBE export, BBEDefs is copied as Defs so that s/Common remains
    unaltered in the BBE.
Admin:
  Tested in manual build.
  Required by RiscOS/Export 0.01 or later (Export-0_01)

Version 1.05. Tagged as 'Messages-1_05'
