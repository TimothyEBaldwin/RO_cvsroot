4.1
log
@Fix spurious assert in MsgTok2. Tidy other utils a bit and rebuild all binaries.
Detail:
  Utils/c/MskTok2 - Fix spurious assert when tokenising a message that runs up to end of buffer and isn't newline terminated
  Utils/Makefile - Tweaked to use CApp makefile fragment
  Utils/MkClean,fd7, Utils/MkCVSClean,fd7 - New scripts for cleaning everything, or for cleaning just the bits we don't want in CVS
  Utils/o - Removed folder, shouldn't be in CVS
  Utils/c/Old - Removed folder, we rely on CVS to store old versions of files
  Utils/c/MsgExt, Utils/c/ScanRes, Utils/c/TokGen, Utils/c/TokGen2 - Fixed dangerous-sounding warnings (potential use of uninitialised variables, wrong fscanf arg type for "%s")
  Utils/*,ff8 - Rebuilt all binaries with Norcroft 5.69
Admin:
  Tested with building/running Iyonix & OMAP3 ROMs
