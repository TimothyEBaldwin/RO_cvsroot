4.1
log
@  Unfinished attempt to make RISC OS 3.1 compatible.
Detail:
  * Softload builds now work
  * Non-internationalised versions of * commands added
  * Currently *Backdrop fails with "Reserved fields must be zero" error on
    RISC OS 3.1 - probably passed up from elsewhere in the OS, since 3.1
    was fussy about such things.
Admin:
  Tested on Virtual A5000.

Version 0.77. Tagged as 'Pinboard-0_77'
