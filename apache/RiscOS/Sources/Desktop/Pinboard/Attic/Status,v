@Restore *AddTinyDir <nothing> functionality.
See ticket #283.
Moved 'Status' document into Docs.
Merged 'Changes' into 'BlackLog' and delete.
Expanded 2x POPs of lr/pc cos ARM deprecated it.
Combined 2x MUL/ADD into MLA so the module is the same size.

log
@Commented out "proginfo" string,no longer used.
Prefixed the pin and addtinydir commands that get saved in the
pinboard file with "X " so your pinboard setup continues even if a file
is no longer available.ROL did this with a new XPin command,not taken.
Merged changes from ROL to allow the icon text to be an arbitary colour
though this can be switched out with "technicolour_text" for the
purists.
Help entry added to the pinboard selection submenu,this will be greyed
out except when
 it's an app
 and it has a !help file
 and it is the only object selected
like the filer does.
Updated messages file accordingly.
Menu clicking on the "save pinboard settings" OK button no longer saves
the file,and adjust clicking keeps the menu tree open
 -> fixes bug report from 1998,now removed from "Status" file
Saveas template resized to match !Edit.
Fixed problem of select dragging a file to an app leaving the icon
selected (due to two conditional MOV R0's being followed by an
unconditional one for some reason).
 -> fixes bug report from 1998,now removed from "Status" file
Tweaked a few CMP#0 BLT's to test specifically for the iconbar handle.
The bug report in "Status" about bits of filenames being left on the
pinboard can be bodged by popping an ADD r0,r0,#16 after the XWimp_TextOp
in s.buffered but I've not done this yet.

@Ursula branch merged.
Added inclusion of Machine header for new CMOS header
Moved to srccommit.
Templates contain hardwired version/date information which is a long
  way out of date.  This has not been fixed in this checkin.

Three bugs are reported in the enclosed emails below.

The only other known bug is that an adjust click on the OK of the pinboard
save dialogue should keep the save box on screen.
