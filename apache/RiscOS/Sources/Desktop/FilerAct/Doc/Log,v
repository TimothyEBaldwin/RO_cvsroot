JSR  10-Jan-1990  Created. For previous entries refer to log.Filer.
                        Changes leading to FilerAct version 0.11.


Version 0.11
 *  Assembler headers now referred to by Hdr: rather than &.Hdr.
 *  Unwanted extra line removed at end of *Filer_Action help text.
 *  Bottom info field set at end of count as per during the count operation.
        This replaces the left justified way this field was set previously.
 *  Routines local to c.actionwind made static.
 *  Make the title of the query box for a prequit match that of the action
        window.

Version 0.12
 *  Inhibit progress increment on delete files if file is locked and not deleted.
 *  Make all functions not declared in headers static.
 *  Store resources using ResourceFS.

Version 0.13
 *  When force is set drop a file's access to wr/ rather than /.

Version 0.14
 *  Link with new stubs for Shared C Library 4.14

Version 0.15
 *  Ensure all static data is initialised so that there is no ZI area.

Version 0.16
 *  Tart up handling of error during _clib_initialisemodule to not cause an
        address exception due to _clib_finalisemodule being called.
 *  Tart up error display to keep desktop active.
 *  Save space from messages: remove defaults from code and remove FilerA
        prefix from messages.

Version 0.17
 *  Re-do internals of memmanage to be (a) simple and (b) faster.
 *  Do buffer size optimisation to speed up copying.
 *  Do translation to load/save where appropriate to speed up copying.
 *  Make Stamp Stamp directories.
 *  Implement faster feature.
 *  Implement options menu for filer_action.
 *  Allow wildcards on find file.

Version 0.18
 *  Fix skip on copying on error on other than read or write.
 *  Fix template to not have 'Next object' in bottom info field.
 *  Fix writing files to always write the access, regardless.
 *  Fix deleting to only attempt delete of a directory *after* its contents.
 *  Fix deleting to only confirm on directories first time directory is encountered.
 *  Fix so that partitions are treated as files for:
        Copy
        Move
        Move(rename)
        Copy local (under new name)
    and as directories for all other operations.
 *  Remove toggle box from action window.

Version 0.19

 *  Truncate file after open when writing to prevent FileSwitch read-before-write.

Version 0.20
 *  Settype turned into a flat (non-recursive) operation not applying to
directories or partitions.
 *  Change overflowing_mallocs to use standard malloc instead and provide an
        extendproc for copying.

Version 0.21
 *  Set access to wr/ to unlock rather than / to avoid DOSFS locking the file.

Version 0.22
 *  Changed to use new ModuleWrap source
 *  init_for_copying now returns slot size too small instead of malloc failed
 *  start_operation now performs a werr, rather than a wimpt_noerr

Version 0.23
 * FilerAct has beem fully internationalised, Messages and Templates files
   moved to the Messages module and errors moved into Messages file.

Version 0.30
 * No longer uses red text in error version of filer action window (does not
   look good in non-system fonts in 16 colour modes).
 * No longer calculates positioning of file names in info box. Icon split into
   right justified path name icon and left justified leaf name icon. This gives
   correct positioning for scaled fonts as well as System font.

Version 0.32
* Tidied up debugging.
* Made Restart actually restart the operation correctly.
* Fixed "do you want this aborted?" message.
* Fine tuned action template.

Version 0.34
 * Fix prequit behaviour so that killing from task manager menu doesn't result
   in the whole desktop dieing around you.

Version 0.35 (SMC)
 * Now looks up command help/syntax in Global.Messages file.
 * Now looks up text for "<many>" and "<nothing>" in Messages file.
