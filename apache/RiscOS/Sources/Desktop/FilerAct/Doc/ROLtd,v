4.1
log
@Added functionality from RISC OS 4.02 (Faster button, 64-bit display, number
separators). This implementation does not use the Netscape libraries, and
looks up the number separation scheme from the current territory.

Now copies directory datestamps, as per the command-line *Copy.

Version 0.46. Tagged as 'FilerAct-0_46'

@RISCOS Ltd notes on FilerAction
=========================

Author: Justin Fletcher
Date:   06 Mar 1999

Summary
-------
FilerAction can be compiled into a simple application using MkApp, which means
it no longer runs from ROM. To re-enable ROM usage, run test.ROMApp.


Options
-------
UseFasterButton  - allows the use of the 'Faster' button.


action_button implementation
----------------------------
Action buttons are set up as a number of handlers, help messages and names
which can be associated with each button. If a null handler and name are
given then the button is not shown and therefore does not affect the display.
Attaching handlers to the skip handler as well as the yes & no handler will
result in overwriting of the same area of the screen.

The help messages and names are looked up in the Messages file.


File/leaf split
---------------
The filename/leafname split occurs at 10 characters in the display and is
handled by set_bottom_info_field in actionwind.c. This splits icons
specifically at the 10 character limit. A simple fix might be to increase this
limit by a character and place an ellipsis after the filename.
