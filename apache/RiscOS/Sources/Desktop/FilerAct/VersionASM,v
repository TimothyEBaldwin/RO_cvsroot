@Fix for NULL pointer dereference skipping/retrying the last file
If an error occurs during an operation (for example, during a copy move where the source is on a read only medium) the status window changes to an error window with "Abort/Skip/Retry". The skip and retry options call read_next_node_parameters() to peek the next queued item, but would attempt to OS_File 5 of a NULL filename if the error happens when there are no more.
Check the next_nodename isn't NULL to avoid an abort in OS_GSInit with zero page protection enabled.

@Fix null pointer dereference when continuing after some errors
Detail:
  c/listfiles - If the first call to enumerate the contents of a directory fails (e.g. when trying to step into a bad image file), next_entry_to_return will be left at a value >= entries_in_buffer. This doesn't impact the operation of the state machine, but it will cause a null/bad pointer dereference in the user interface code when switch_buttons() calls read_next_node_parameters() and the code attempts to construct the path name of the current object. Fix the issue by terminating the path if an invalid cache entry index is found.

@Fix for occasional divide-by-zero in filer copies
An else clause was being run for both the "write not complete" case but also when an error had occurred in an earlier step. The error would generally be a failure to create and hence a file size of zero. Bang.
Steps to recreate (other, more obscure and hard to catch cases exist)
 1. Open ResourceFS
 2. Copy Resources:$.Resources to Resources:$.Apps
 3. As ResourceFS is read only the reads all buffer OK but the first write (should return 'read only') gives divide-by-zero

@Fix file type not being applied when copying image files
Detail:
  c/memmanage - An earlier fix to prevent directory filetypes being applied to image files had the unintended side-effect of stopping image file types being applied to anything other than an existing image file.
  Check has now been revised to only limit the application of directory types to image files; there's no need to worry about image file types being applied to directories, as the filer won't let you copy a (image) file over a directory in the first place.

@  No longer trashes filetype and user access bits when copying a directory over an image file
Detail:
  Was doing a cimple copy of the load/execution and attribute words from the
  source to the destination. However, for directories the filetype bits in the
  load address are always &FFD (data) and the user access bits are always 0
  (even though all directories actually have user read/write access). Now
  these bits are left alone when updating an image file from a directory.

@Fix to work with files > 2G.
A good rake over the code to change filesizes to be uint32_t not ints.
Change makefile to use StdTools.
Shuffle icon clipping in the templates to allow for maximal numbers by moving the text a bit to the right, still fits even in system font.
A couple more ints swapped for BOOLs.
The memmanage code is largely unchanged and makes extensive use of signed numbers, partly because the wimpslot setting API does. This will all fall over in a big mess if the wimpslot ever gets >2G, but then the API would need changing for that to happen anyway.
Function count_objects_in_dir swapped to use os_gbpb.
Structure search_nest_level gains a 'counted' flag rather than signalling counting is needed by setting the filesize to -1.
Should now be good for up to 4 billion files each of 4 billion bytes.

@Fix display of bytes-to-go when there are > 2G left.
Was doing a widening cast of a signed number to 64 bits, so showed 16 trillion bytes remaining.
Fix templates to not say "stuff" by default in the name, as this was left on screen if an error occured before processing began.
Things that read from clock() now use clock_t.
Uncurled some "} else {" to match all the other files.
Deleted the USE_LONG_LONG switch, it's been needed ever since harddiscs got bigger than 4G anyway.
Anything assigned 'Yes' or 'No' changed to type BOOL.
Variable 'source_of_finished_file' was signalling that a directory had been copied by setting the length to a -ve number. This has been refactored to use a BOOL instead, so files can have top bit set sizes.
Fix bug in stack grab in count_objects_in_dir(), was grabbing an array of 2048 pointers (=8k) not 2048 bytes.
Functions bytes_left_to_read() and bytes_left_to_write() reprototyped to return uint32_t not signed numbers.
Still falls over copying files > 2G, but at least it gets the display right!

@  Minor improvement to enable optional skipping of objects during copies.
Detail:
  If the system variable Filer_Action$Skip is set (to anything - even the
    null string), then during a Copy operation, Filer_Action will skip
    directories called "CVS" and files called "/cvstag".  Variable is read
    whenever Filer_Action desktop task starts (ie. at the start of each
    copy).  This dramatically reduces the time it takes to copy a checkout
    tree from NFS->RISC OS.
