@Fix display of bytes-to-go when there are > 2G left.
Was doing a widening cast of a signed number to 64 bits, so showed 16 trillion bytes remaining.
Fix templates to not say "stuff" by default in the name, as this was left on screen if an error occured before processing began.
Things that read from clock() now use clock_t.
Uncurled some "} else {" to match all the other files.
Deleted the USE_LONG_LONG switch, it's been needed ever since harddiscs got bigger than 4G anyway.
Anything assigned 'Yes' or 'No' changed to type BOOL.
Variable 'source_of_finished_file' was signalling that a directory had been copied by setting the length to a -ve number. This has been refactored to use a BOOL instead, so files can have top bit set sizes.
Fix bug in stack grab in count_objects_in_dir(), was grabbing an array of 2048 pointers (=8k) not 2048 bytes.
Functions bytes_left_to_read() and bytes_left_to_write() reprototyped to return uint32_t not signed numbers.
Still falls over copying files > 2G, but at least it gets the display right!

log
@Added functionality from RISC OS 4.02 (Faster button, 64-bit display, number
separators). This implementation does not use the Netscape libraries, and
looks up the number separation scheme from the current territory.

Now copies directory datestamps, as per the command-line *Copy.
