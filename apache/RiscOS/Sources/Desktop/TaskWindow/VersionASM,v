@Fix 32bit conversion issue
Detail:
  s/Taskman - Generation of TaskWindow_Dying error within ByteV handler wasn't balancing the stack correctly, causing it to try branching to the PSR. Fix this, and tighten up the code a bit (can use R0 as temp as it'll always be set to something sensible on exit)
Admin:
  Tested on iMx6
  Fixes reported issue with machine stiffing when killing task windows containing running programs
  Issue was only observed on pre-PMP kernel version, where the code would have branched into the free pool (loaded PSR appeared to be &80000193), corrupted some memory, and then got stuck in a loop
  Presumably this has never been spotted on other systems because there would have rarely been any memory at that location, generating an immediate abort, but the error message gets swallowed because the task is exiting? (or there was memory there, but the user got lucky and the code aborts before fatally corrupting anything)

@  Corrected SVC stack save code.
Detail:
  The bottom four words of the SVC stack were being preserved across calls
  to Wimp_Poll. This is a curious choice, since the bottom seven words are
  reserved to hold run-time data, and C libraries to date have only used
  two words (the library and client relocation offsets). Changed to save
  all seven reserved words across Wimp_Poll.

  Tested briefly on an Iyonix, with no visible ill effects.

> If it just lets the Wimp do the queueing it goes quite a lot faster!
>
> It only polls the wimp once every 10 buffer fulls of data, so is pretty
> nippy, but doesn't stall when doing a lot of text output in SVC mode.
>
> It also assembles to use TickerV instead of VSync (unless you unset the
> flag).

@  Added niceness.
  Reintroduced buffer enlargements.

Detail:
  A new flag has been added, '-nice <n>' which if specified allows
modification of the default number of VSyncs before task switching.  This
works a bit like UNIX nice, hence the name.  A nice value of 1 will make
multitasking very smooth.  It also allows relative priority to be specified
between taskwindows.  So the default is 10, and a nice 1 taskwindow will get
10 times less CPU time than a default window.  A nice 100 taskwindow would
get 10 times as much CPU time as a default one.

  The buffer enlargements were inadvertantly checked over in a previous
checkin.  They have now been re-introduced.

  Tested on a RiscPC.

@  Added pollidle handling for INKEY (OS_Byte 129)

Detail:
  Taskwindow sits of BYTEV and waits for n*2 Vsyncs when INKEY(n) is called.
This isn't quite correct as VSyncs aren't a reliable timing source, however,
leaving that aside for the moment, what Taskwindow was doing was sitting on
Null events until it read that enough Vsyncs had passed, thus eating up CPU
time.

  The new behaviour is to call Wimp_PollIdle instead, which should also
correct the amount of time waited for.  This behaviour can be toggled with
the build switch PollIdleHandling.

Admin:
  Lightly tested on a RPC.  Using AppStat, no call were made to the
taskwindow during and INKEY, whereas they were previously.

@  Made UpCall 6 work with pollwords.

Detail:
  UpCall 6 is documented as accepting a pollword which can be scanned for
being non zero to return control to the process requesting to sleep.  This
was not being used within the taskwindow module, there being a comment where
it would have been used suggesting that this would give the taskwindow too
high a priority.  What this means is that if given a pollword that is already
nonzero, the task would receive so many polls as to really make the desktop
juddery.  The solution is that if the pollword is non-zero on entry,
Wimp_Null is unmasked rather than passing the pollword.

  This means that UpCall 6 can be used either as a yield, to say 'let other
tasks have some CPU now' (by passing a pollword known to contain nonzero) or
as sleep to say 'wake me up when the pollword becomes non zero, and don't
consume any CPU time until then' (by passing a pollword that will only become
nonzero upon the occurance of a specific event).

@  Fixed response to UpCall Sleep No More.

Detail:
  The UpCall wasn't being claimed because the common error creating return
was being used which returns to lr rather than popping the stack.  Now the
error routine is BLed to and then the stack popped so as to claim the UpCall.

    transmitted rather than a stream of small messages.

log
@  YSync event enabling now done on the same basis as vector claiming.
Detail:
  TaskWindow used to enable VSync events for each new task that was
    started.  However, it failed to disable the VSync events again
    when the task exited unless the task was the last one running.
    This meant that VSyncs would be going off for no reason at all
    slowing the machine down if you had ever started a taskwindow.
    Events are now only ever enabled when the first task is created,
    and disabled when the last task is killed.

@  32-bit compatible.
Detail:
  Fixed the spurious character problem.  It was due to me believing some
    misleading comments in the source code.  When the comment said "pass
    it on" (at the end of a vector handler), it actually meant "claim it".
    WrchV is now claimed correctly, and no output is "leaked" any more.

@  32-bit compatible
Detail:
  Removed obsolete file.
  Made rest of the module 32-bit safe.
  A bug remains: when a taskwindow is started the first few characters of
    output are not being intercepted correctly (although they are sent to
    the parent task).  Looks as if something isn't initialised correctly?
    Perhaps a failure to intercept WrchV in these cases?
Admin:
  Tested in Ursula softload.
