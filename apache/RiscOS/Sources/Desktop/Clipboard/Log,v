log
@* Standardised all error blocks to use AddError/MakeErrorBlock macros
* Routines added for making "safe" copies of data blocks, data type lists
  and leafnames passed in via the various mechanisms
* SWI Clipboard_Put and Message_DataRequest handler implemented, and the
  supporting state handlers
    State_PutRequest1
    State_DataSave
    State_RAMTransmit
    State_DataLoad
* SWI Clipboard_GetDataType implemented, and the supporting handler
    State_PutRequest2
    (but not State_DataRequest2 yet)
* Now requires that the caller is an active task
* Fixed occasional data abort bug in MySendMessage
* Fixed corruption of wimp event code bug
* Implemented and added test applications

Change Log
==========

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.01 (19 Jun 1996)  KBracey

* Initial version

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.02 (10 Nov 1998)  BAvison

* Added missing struct definitions needed to compile
* Tidied up code and build structure
* Modified to use srccommit
* Introduced makefile (and non-stand-alone export / ROM build capabilities)
* Split Messages into CmdHelp and Messages
* Introduced this log file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.03 (12 Feb 1999)  BAvison

* Makefile altered to build separate targets for RAM and ROM builds
* Makefile supports LocalRes$Path
* General tidying up of source
* Drag-and-Drop features optioned out (implementation is unlikely in first
  release)
* R0 passed to Wimp_Initialise now a recognised value
* Ursula fast service call table added
* Now launches task when module is RMRun
* Error handler modified to have a Quit button instead of Cancel
* Debug builds append error PC to error message in error handler error box

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.04 (19 Feb 1999)  BAvison

* Updated API to match that from the spec 1309,419/FS
* Added symbols for all flag bits in SWIs and messages
* Major reorganisation of workspace layout, primarily to facilitate multiple
  concurrent data transfer transactions - because of this, most of the
  useful functionality is currently commented out, pending updating to use
  the new structures
* Replaced "event" queue with a simple queue of ready-to-send Wimp message
  blocks - this way, event handling can be handled in the same place in the
  code, irrespective of whether we're in the foreground or background
* Reorganised finalisation code so that task and module operations are
  performed in separate routines and (mostly) in strictly the reverse order
  to at initialisation. This allows code sharing between module finalisation,
  the exit handler, the UpCall_NewApplication handler, and the task quit
  code, as well as eradicating several memory leaks in the process

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.05 (22 Feb 1999)  BAvison

* Task-related initialisation moved from module init to Start routine
* State handler added, called from SWI, UserMessage, UserMessageAck handlers
* Implemented NewAction, DeleteAction, DeleteActions, FreeClipboard and
  FreeMsgQueue
* DA memory allocation adapted so as not to use max-size "-1" DAs
* RMA memory allocation functions completed to match DA functions - will now
  assemble with DA support option turned off!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.06 (25 Feb 1999)  BAvison

* Standardised all error blocks to use AddError/MakeErrorBlock macros
* Routines added for making "safe" copies of data blocks, data type lists
  and leafnames passed in via the various mechanisms

  supporting state handlers
    State_PutRequest1
    State_DataSave
    State_RAMTransmit
    State_DataLoad
* SWI Clipboard_GetDataType implemented, and the supporting handler
    State_PutRequest2
    (but not State_DataRequest2 yet)
* Now requires that the caller is an active task
* Fixed occasional data abort bug in MySendMessage
* Fixed corruption of wimp event code bug
* Implemented and added test applications
