@  Completed the clipboard support part of the Clipboard module.
  Drag-and-Drop support still needs to be designed and implemented.
Detail:
  The initial Clipboard module released by ROOL was in a state of flux due
  to a redesign of how the module worked. The transition to the new way
  of doing things was only done partially and needed completing to make the
  Clipboard module support the clipboard fully. The module also contained
  26-bit only code.

  - Replaced all the 26-bit code with 32-bit (not mode neutral) code.

  - Completed implementation of Clipboard_GetDataType by adding support for
    the situation where the Clipboard module doesn't own the clipboard and
    isn't proxying either. The required StateHandler_DataRequest2 has been
    implemented also.

  - Fully implemented Clipboard_Get including all the required statehandlers.
      StateHandler_DataSaveAck
      StateHandler_RAMFetch1
      StateHandler_RAMFetch2
      StateHandler_DataRequest1
      StateHandler_DataRequest2
      StateHandler_PutRequest3
      StateHandler_Paste

  - Modified CopyData routine to allow for clipboard content not being
    word-aligned and/or its length not being a multiple of four.

  - Removed all the commented out code that was left over from the initial
    implementation of the Clipboard module.

  - Added GetData to the set of test applications. It displays the clipboard
    contents if it's of type text (It's best to use short text strings). It's
    not very polished and it's better to use PutClip and GetClip to test the
    Clipboard module.

  - Added PutClip to the set of test applications. It can be used test
    SWI Clipboard_Put. Details on how can be found in its Help file.

  - Added GetClip to the set of test applications. It can be used test
    SWI Clipboard_Get. Details on how can be found in its Help file.
Admin:
  Extensively tested on Iyonix RO 5.11 both external behaviour with PutClip
  and GetClip as well as the internal behaviour of the statehandler (by using
  StrongED as the clipboard owner/requester and rigging it to fail at certain
  points during the datatransfer).

  Briefly tested on RO 4.02, seems to be OK.

  Briefly tested on RO 6.06, seems to be OK. Functionality may be different
  from 5.11 and 4.02 though due to ClipboardHolder. In particular using the
  Clipboard module as a proxy is likely to be affected.

@Fixed Clipboard to build and made it 32bit.
Detail:
  Clipboard has never been 32bitted, therefore it refused to build for
  Tungsten. It's now been fixed to build. It's still not finished though.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC RO402. Module checked with ARMalyser.
Notes:
  Changes by James Lampard.

@* Standardised all error blocks to use AddError/MakeErrorBlock macros
* Routines added for making "safe" copies of data blocks, data type lists
  and leafnames passed in via the various mechanisms
* SWI Clipboard_Put and Message_DataRequest handler implemented, and the
  supporting state handlers
    State_PutRequest1
    State_DataSave
    State_RAMTransmit
    State_DataLoad
* SWI Clipboard_GetDataType implemented, and the supporting handler
    State_PutRequest2
    (but not State_DataRequest2 yet)
* Now requires that the caller is an active task
* Fixed occasional data abort bug in MySendMessage
* Fixed corruption of wimp event code bug
* Implemented and added test applications

1.3
log
@* Updated API to match that from the spec 1309,419/FS
* Added symbols for all flag bits in SWIs and messages
* Major reorganisation of workspace layout, primarily to facilitate multiple
  concurrent data transfer transactions - because of this, most of the
  useful functionality is currently commented out, pending updating to use
  the new structures
* Replaced "event" queue with a simple queue of ready-to-send Wimp message
  blocks - this way, event handling can be handled in the same place in the
  code, irrespective of whether we're in the foreground or background
* Reorganised finalisation code so that task and module operations are
  performed in separate routines and (mostly) in strictly the reverse order
  to at initialisation. This allows code sharing between module finalisation,
  the exit handler, the UpCall_NewApplication handler, and the task quit
  code, as well as eradicating several memory leaks in the process
