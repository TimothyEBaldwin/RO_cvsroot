@* Standardised all error blocks to use AddError/MakeErrorBlock macros
* Routines added for making "safe" copies of data blocks, data type lists
  and leafnames passed in via the various mechanisms
* SWI Clipboard_Put and Message_DataRequest handler implemented, and the
  supporting state handlers
    State_PutRequest1
    State_DataSave
    State_RAMTransmit
    State_DataLoad
* SWI Clipboard_GetDataType implemented, and the supporting handler
    State_PutRequest2
