4.1
log
@  Bugfixing, Sprites11 support and stretchy command windows.
Detail:
  * Bugfix: the contents of the pollword returned in the poll block by
    a PollWordNonZero event, where the pollword was flagged as high
    priority, was rotated by 8 bits due to a internal top-bit-set
    workaround. This no longer happens. (This was causing OmniClient never
    to complete initialisation on my machine.)
  * Extended the alternate resolution icon scheme for RAM/ROM sprites and
    toolsprites to be multi-pass, enabling the use of extra sprite sets for
    weird modes (most notably EX0 EY0 ones). After '23' or '0' suffixes
    (the latter still only applies to toolsprites), the suffix for the
    equivalent polychromatic resolution is tried. After rectangular
    suffixes, the next larger squarer suffix is tried. After '11', '22' is
    tried. Failing all of these, a match is attempted with no suffix.
  * The command window is now scaled and centred to match the current screen
    mode - up to a maximum size of 1280 x 1024 OS units.
  * Fixed the *WimpVisualFlags help strings (again).
  * Fixed 'task2' debugging to know about the structure of the SVC stack on
    32-bit machines.
  * Added support for generation of GPA files.
Admin:
  Tested on Tungsten.
