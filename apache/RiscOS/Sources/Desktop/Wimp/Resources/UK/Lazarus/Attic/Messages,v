1.2
log
@  Various little changes.
Detail:
  * New STB Sprites, Templates and Tools files imported, based upon the
    Lazarus UI rather than the old STB UI.
  * STB build now includes WIMPSymbol.
  * No longer attempts to use WIMPSymbol font in UTF8 builds which didn't
    register the font in ResourceFS.
  * Simplified Resources directories by assigning only a single pair of
    Messages files to each locale, rather than for each UI directory within
    each locale directory. The only code change required is to make the Wimp
    error box always use the "Continue" token for NC/STB builds, rather than
    using one of "OK" and "Continue", as with desktop builds.
Admin:
  Not tested.
