log
@  Various little changes.
Detail:
  * New STB Sprites, Templates and Tools files imported, based upon the
    Lazarus UI rather than the old STB UI.
  * STB build now includes WIMPSymbol.
  * No longer attempts to use WIMPSymbol font in UTF8 builds which didn't
    register the font in ResourceFS.
  * Simplified Resources directories by assigning only a single pair of
    Messages files to each locale, rather than for each UI directory within
    each locale directory. The only code change required is to make the Wimp
    error box always use the "Continue" token for NC/STB builds, rather than
    using one of "OK" and "Continue", as with desktop builds.
Admin:
  Not tested.

1.4
log
@UTF-8 support from previous version switched in; additional alphabet-
conditional support added as follows:
* Correctly converts character index returned from Font_FindCaret into byte
  index into raw string.
* Left-arrow, right-arrow, delete-left and delete-right now act as far as
  the next character boundary, instead of to the next byte.
* Menu item text justification works again (it relies on overwriting spaces
  with hard space characters, which are two-byte characters in UTF-8).
* General key handling code has been rewritten. The Wimp now has three
  internal key input buffers - one each for taking keyboard-generated,
  task-generated, and function-key-generated strings. Each input buffer is
  processed in chunks of one character, rather than one byte; malformed
  UTF-8 characters are rejected, so tasks don't have to worry about them
  (simplifying their character-handling code). There is also a key output
  buffer, to ensure that (UTF-8) sequences of Key_Pressed events are not
  broken up.
* As a result of the above, multiple calls to Wimp_ProcessKey are now
  possible between calls to Wimp_Poll. Previously, this resulted in bytes
  getting jumbled up - making it useless for input of UTF-8 characters.
* Multi-byte characters are inserted into writeable icons in one go, so you
  don't see a brief flicker of the "malformed character" symbol while the
  initial bytes are being inserted.
* Multi-byte characters that don't entirely fit in a writeable icon buffer
  are not inserted at all.
* A new validation string command ("U") can limit the contents of a
  writeable by number of characters, instead of bytes. This will hide the
  character sizes from the user interface.
* Allowable characters (validation string command "A") now works on Unicode
  characters and character ranges.
* Various other minor bugs are fixed (Wimp_ProcessKey 13 can activate a
  writeable menu item, Shift-arrow keys are always consistent in firing off
  Key_Pressed events, etc.)
* Password icons supported: one symbol is displayed for each character
  (instead of for each byte); the display character (validation string
  command "D") can be any UTF-8 character; correctly displays the caret
  after set-caret-by-index calls, even though characters in the processed
  string are different width to those in the raw string, in password icons.

Other changes:
* The border around NC-style error boxes is resized when the error window
  is grown or shrunk.
* Messages, CmdHelp and Template files made consistent across resource
  directories, including support for all Ursula features.
* ShrinkableAreas turned back on in System=RCA builds.
* User interface features of desktop OS builds standardised.
