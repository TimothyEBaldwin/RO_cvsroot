  * Translations for Bethany project incorporated.

Detail:

  * Translated resources added for the following locales:

      France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey

    Files changed include the Messages, Template and Sprite files, all
    of which now contain appropriate translated versions.

Admin:

  * Tested in Bethany multi-locale builds.

  * Sprite file contains an equivalent set of sprites to those in the
    UK variant; no rationalisation has been applied to remove duplicates
    contained in the NCFrescoRO resources (jberanek_NCFrescoRO-2_67_Lazarus
    branch version).

Version 4.36, 4.46.2.2. Tagged as 'Wimp-4_36-4_46_2_2'
