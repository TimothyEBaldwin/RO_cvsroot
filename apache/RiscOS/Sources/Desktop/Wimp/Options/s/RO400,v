@Fix for corrupt register in pushfontstring with password-style substitution
When CnP=TRUE but UTF8=FALSE the code path through pushfontstring for icons using the 'D' validation string would use R11 as a temporary without having preserved it (the UTF8 case preserves it because it uses R11 as a bitmask of substitutes).
Changed to always preserve R11, the routine is so huge one extra pushed register isn't going to slow it down measurably.
Adjusted options files now this combination is safe.

@Refinements to disc based targets especially
Previous attempt to disable Sprites11 support for 3.10 and 3.50 hadn't spotted it was reenabled in the common options, also the Sprites11 switch was also tied up in Wimp$IconTheme support.
Title bars would flicker when picked up when using a tool sprite set with no 'p' pushed equivalents on RISC OS 4.0x due to screen cache.
Makefile now installs a default set of tools & sprites when target is ThemeDefs.
CLI limit reduced to 256 pre Ursula to save RAM.

Options/!Common:
  Promote Sprites11 switch into !Default
  Remove fixrmatools
Options/!Default:
  Sprites11 true by default
  LongCommandLines true by default, false on targets pre Ursula
  Remove ServiceCallTable (harmless to have it in all cases)
NewSWIs.s:
  Enable Wimp_Extend 13 all the time
Wimp01.s:
  Reduce RMA use by vital 1.5k for non long command line case
  Change sense of Sprites11 switch to adopt all its previous functionality, but not look for '11' suffix when the switch is false
  Adopt ServiceCallTable switch permanently
Wimp02.s:
  Comments ammended
Wimp07.s:
  Range of ADR
Wimp10.s:
  Change sense of Sprites11 switch to adopt all its previous functionality, but not look for '11' suffix when the switch is false
  Adopt :LNOT: fixrmatools switch permanently
  Supress title bar sprite plotting when none of the sprites exist

@Slacken pointer checks
The pointer comparison checking required when running in a system with > 64M memory was tightened up from Wimp-4_75 to Wimp-4_76, but to allow the module to target pre RISC OS 5 systems an option to relax those checks is required.
Each check has been revisited and where appropriate demarked with a "AcceptLoosePointer" macro, which just remaps the pointer into the stricter form and carries on. In the strict checking case, the macro reduces to nothing.

Detail:
Add AcceptLoosePointers switch.
Retire singular use of StrongARM switch (calling XOS_SynchroniseCodeAreas is harmless pre StrongARM anyway).
Rename Ursula_RPC options to RO400.
Put duplicate documentation in the attic.
Allow -2 or -1 as the iconbar handle in Wimp_ResizeIcon (ticket #203).
Tighten up the list terminator check in the DebugMemory switch of Memory.s

Tested on RISC OS 3.10 (emulated), 3.50, 3.60, 3.70, 4.02.
