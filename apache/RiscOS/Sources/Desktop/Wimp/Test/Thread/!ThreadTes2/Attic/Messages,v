1.1.2.1
log
@  Added Dan Ellis's multithreading support, on a development branch for now.
Detail:
  This breaks the equivalence between tasks and AMB slots, allowing many
  threads of execution to share the same AMB slot, where an application's
  heap is usually located. In API terms, it is presented as an extension to
  Wimp_StartTask, see Docs/Multithreading for more information. It is the
  caller's responsibility to create a new stack chunk for the new thread if
  required. Note that BASIC's variable storage model is fundamentally
  unsuited for multithreading.
Admin:
  This was developed in 2001 and was not committed at the time due to lack
  of testing and peer review. It is now being added as a branch from a
  contemporary trunk Wimp. Hopefully somebody will be interested enough to
  merge the branch into a recent version!

Version 4.66, 4.77.2.1. Tagged as 'Wimp-4_66-4_77_2_1'
