1.1
log
@  Minor resources change to all templates files.
Detail:
  The titlebar and input focus colours for the window template for
  error boxes is now cream (12). This is more intuitive. Builds which
  do not have a title bar will not look any different.
Admin:
  Included the little utility which did the modification in Test/ResMod
  (as in Resources Modifier - but who cares). May be of use in future.
