@  Changes to header file handling
Detail:
  Filing system handler reason codes moved into Hdr:Free so they can be used
  from other modules. Also created a C version of the header, Interface/Free.h
Admin:
  Shouldn't be any functional change to the Free module itself.
  Worth noting that the PRM and the updated docs herein are wrong: the handler
  can be entered in either USR mode or SVC mode, depending upon the reason
  code (1 and 3 SVC mode, 2 and 4 USR mode). This makes implementing the
  handler in C "interesting"...

Version 0.41. Tagged as 'Free-0_41'
