4.1
log
@  Some changes I made to build a RISC OS 3.1 softload version.
Detail:
  * Can now build versions compatible with RISC OS 3.5 or earlier (non-
    internationalised commands were missing)
  * Fixed a mistake in the Messages file that caused suboptimal tokenisation
  * Added a MkRam TaskObey file to ease standalone builds
Admin:
  Tested on Virtual A5000!

Version 2.04. Tagged as 'Filer-2_04'
