@Minor filer fixes
When a viewer is in 'sort by size' mode the size of image files was not being considered. So, a dir full of ZIP files (SparkFS not run) would be in size order amongst the other files, but if SparkFS was running the image files would be sorted as dirs of 0 size.
Fix for ticket #400, the *Filer_Run command now defaults to '-noshift' and inspecting the shift key state must be requested (opt in instead of opt out). This solves two key annoyances, running the !Boot sequence and holding shift causes you to enter the desktop with the obey files from the Tasks directory unhelpfully loaded in a text editor, and when setting a task alarm in !Alarm if the alarm happens to go off when you're typing with the shift key the task's !Run file opens in a text editor.

SortDir.s: count image files as files so they're sorted like they were in Filer 2.26
Commands.s: parse new option switch, and consider -noshift the default
Messages/HelpSrc: add the switch to the command syntax

Tested with a task alarm in !Alarm with and without shift held down, and running a !Boot sequence similarly.

@Add support for sorting dir contents numerically as well as alphabetically
New option to the display menu "Numerical sort" modifies the existing 4 sort methods (name, size, type, date) to sort by interpreting any numbers as cardinals. This modifier only really has effect on "Sort by name" since the other three already sort numerically.
This means for example a dir containing "File9,File10,File11" will appear in that order, whereas sorting by name alone would show "File10,File11,File9".

SelStuff0.s/SelStuff.s/Gets.s: Removed. Single function placed into SelStuff.
ModHdr.s/OpenDir.s/Commands.s/DebugFlags.s: Decoding of -NumericalSort switch, switched out undocumented 'Query' flags.
DecodeMenu.s/MenuCreate.s: Handle menu entry, simplify rename code a little.
HelpSrc.s/Messages: Extra help text.
SortDir.s: Pass option flag to Territory_Collate.
WkspEtc.s: Corrected definition of db_sm_type and db_sm_size.

@Adjust tokenisation hints
The syntax messages for Filer_ commands are also needed by the ReadArgs macro which, unlike OSCLI, can't pass Token0 in r2 for expansion, resulting in garbled error messages.
Hints changed to just use DictTokens only on syntax messages, and directed Token0 hints on the help messages.
Updated missing German translations too.
Fixes ticket #329.

@Adjust shortcut key
Turns out !Draw and !Edit (from which the delete precedent was taken) were themselves not the best example, this change uses the approved ^K key combo.
German messages updated to include shortcut menu hints.

@Swap hot key for something less fat finger prone
When used with 'confirm deletes' off (which is probably a common mode of operation so as to not have to confirm every single file) it's now all too easy to delete whole directories of files if selected.
Shortcut key changed to CTRL-X (to match the build in apps) and pave the way for a future with CTRL-C and CTRL-V ala Windows.

@  Add the ability to sort Filer objects in reverse order
Detail:
  It's been possible to sort Filer objects using various criteria for a long
  time but sorting objects in reverse order was not possible. This change aims
  to remedy that omission.
  The option 'Reverse sort' has been added to the 'Display' submenu of the
  Filer menu, allowing the sort order of individual directory viewers to be
  changed dynamically.
  The switch -ReverseSort has been added to the command Filer_OpenDir to allow
  it to open directories with the sort order reversed.
  The switch -ReverseSort has been added to the Filer_Layout command so that
  reverse sort order can be set as default for new directory viewers. The
  Filer_Layout command is also written to the FlrSetup file in Choices:Boot.
  Tasks by the Filer configure plug-in (which has been also updated to allow
  -ReverseSort).

@  Make doubleclick-and-hold configurable
Detail:
  Added the command Filer_DClickHold to the Filer.
  It allows you to specify how long the second click of a doubleclick must be
  held down for before it is seen as a doubleclick-and-hold.
  The delay is specified in centiseconds, setting the delay to zero turns
  doubleclick-and-hold off.

@  Added a refresh item to the filer main menu.
Detail:
  When viewing directories on some network filing systems it is possible
  for the directory contents to change without the client knowing, and
  therefore the filer window becomes out of date. This refresh option
  can be used by the user to bring the window up to date without having
  to close and reopen it.
  It matches the same option provided on later versions of RISC OS 4.

@  The following were present in RISC OS 5.00/5.01:
  * "Directory" string removed from "New directory" dialogue box template.
    Unlike the version shipped in 5.00 and 5.01, this template file doesn't
    have its "Recurse" option button in the "Access details" dialogue box
    deselected.
  * When "New directory" dialogue box is opened, contents of the writable
    icon is now set to a null string, rather than the uninternationalised
    "Directory" that was used previously.
  * Uses OS_HeapSort32 instead of OS_HeapSort when the RMA is high.
  The following are new since then:
  * Fixed rubber dragboxes to use exclusive maximum coordinates, stops you
    dragging the box off the left hand side of the window.
  * Enabled SetDirectory option. Merged in 4.02's SetDirectoryComesFirst
    option, changed token in Messages file to read "Set work directory"
    instead of "Set directory" to match 4.02, and added the missing token
    MH?7? for interactive help.
