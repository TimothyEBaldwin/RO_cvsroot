        TTL     > <wini>arm.Filer.Filer

; 0.83  Fix 'Select All' to unset menu_causedselection, also free TempString
;       more frequently. Made byte/word use of d_nfiles consistent.
; 0.84  lhs drag doesn't close parent!
;       Copy/Move/Wipe verbose/confirm are in CMOS; read CMOS each time
;       Rename gets dirtying complete
;       Only CDir allows spaces in validation string
; 0.85  Window opens more pleasant
;       Gets reencoding menus right after a recache!
; 0.86  Made handling of load = exec better

; All changes for Arthur 1.86 release marked >>>a186<<<
; 0.87  Made approved change so validation string for Copy/Rename better
; 0.88  Made version that didn't treat Command files specially
;       and removed selection after more menu ops (copy/rename/cdir/count)
; 0.89  Made menu tree collapse in access dbox errors
; 1.00  Attempt to limit damage by large names from romfs. Release

; ---- Released for Arthur 2.00 ----

; 1.01  Added Set Type option on file menu, found access non-grey bug
; 1.02  Fix001: Grey out 'access =>' when not owner
; 1.03  Fix002: Blame Wimp for naff errors
; 1.04  Retain selection over window updates if still present
;       Retain selection over certain operations if still present
;       Fix003: Ensure ClearAllSelections called with correct r2
; 1.05  JSR 10-May-89: Added call to Hdr.CMOS after split-up of Hdr.System
;                      to re-incorporate the parallel change.
;                      Shift-EXT-close leaves child open, and opens parent.
;                      Drag to icon bar, but not to an icon, does a
;                      Data_Open on all but directories.
; 1.06  JSR 12-May-89: Correct handling of icon columns, for bug 1596.
;                      Problem was that dvr_rhsgap, the gap at the right of
;                      directory viewers was not handled correctly when
;                      calculating number of columns of icons. Also, columns
;                      in dirviewers not zeroed, which avoids fitting window
;                      to columns. Add dvr_rhsslack to give a bit of slack
;                      before reshape when user narrows window.
;                      Centralise and rationalise directory viewer wrapping.
;                      Method used is minorly redifine results from OpenDir
;                      and add routine WrappingOpenDir. Also constants
;                      named db_fpr_... added for special meaning values
;                      of field d_filesperrow.
;                      *filer_opendir functionality greatly increased: can
;                      specify where, how big and viewmode on command line.
; 1.07  JSR 19-May-89  Add save display and close all options to display
;                      sub-menu.

; 1.08  JSR 01-Jun-89  Re-organise the filer directory.
;       JSR 09-Jun-89  Add code to issue filer action requests

;                      Fix wacky bug that caused empty dir viewers to be openned too high
;                      Fix swapping of sort by type and size flags when saved.
;                      Check the path length before constructing a message with it
;                      Add routine is_copy_recursive to disable recursive copying or moving
;                      Make sure first letters of menu entries are capital
;                      Separate handling of *filer_closedir after having extended
;                          *filer_opendir for the open at functionality
;                      Add stamp option
;                      Downgrade the reopen severity after a recache to a reshape.
;                      Correct the calculations of x and ywindsize
;                      Only invoke applications when dragging to icon bar
;                      Implement *Filer_Run

;                      Correct strcmp to terminate at a ctrl char or r6 rather than

;                         updated object doesn't have a :, & or $ starting
