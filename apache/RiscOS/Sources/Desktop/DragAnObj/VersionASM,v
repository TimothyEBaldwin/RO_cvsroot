@The "call user mode function" option for DragAnObject has always been broken -
it has always actually called you in SVC mode. Despite this clients have
coped (such as Browse). But on 32-bit systems, this option leads to a
stack limit that looks higher than the (SVC) stack pointer, leading to
stack overflows and aborts. The module has been adjusted so that the stack
limit is set to the bottom of the SVC stack rather than 0 to fix this.

I've chosen not to fix this option to actually call clients in user mode, as
our broken behaviour may have led to broken clients with the option set wrong.

Instead, I've added a new flag bit 18 that indicates to really call the
client in user mode. Bit 17 should be clear if bit 18 is set. This recovers
sl,fp and sp from the SVC stack and calls the client. The environment should
be set up well enough to allow full access to user and C library statics.
For this to work, DragAnObject_Start must have been called in user mode
from an APCS program, and any SWI veneer used to issue the SWI must have
left R10 and R11 (sl & fp) intact. _kernel_swi is fine, and _swi is fine
except in an unpatched RISC OS 3.70/3.71.

@  Fixed mis-optimisation in SWI dispatcher.
  Fixed dispatch of redraw routine.
Detail:
  The dispatch routine was horrendously complicated for no apparent
    reason.  Use of three conditionally executed instructions means
    that a single routine can be used instead of two very similar
    routines.
  Minor cockup with a condition code in the SWI dispatcher resulted in
    both DragAnObject_Start and DragAnObject_Stop simply calling
    DragASprite_Stop.  The _Start SWI does actually start a drag now.
  You get a proper error if you try to call any other DragAnObject SWIs.
Admin:
  Tested in desktop build - objects can be dragged now.

@  32-bit compatible.
  Improvements to SWI dispatcher (should be much faster now)
Detail:
  There's much less faffing about done in the SWI dispatcher - no need
    to set up fake return addresses and the like.  Amusingly it never
    generates errors because it fails to restore flags correctly on SWI
    exit which it had carefully remembered before freeing up memory.
Admin:
  Tested in desktop build.
