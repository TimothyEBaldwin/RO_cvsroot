@Merge HAL branch to trunk
Detail:
  This change merges the past 15+ years of HAL branch development back to the trunk.
  This is effectively the end for non-HAL builds of the kernel, as no attempt has been made to maintain it during this merge, and all non-HAL & non-32bit code will soon be removed anyway.
  Rather than list everything that's been added to the HAL branch, it's easier to describe the change in terms of the things that the HAL branch was lacking:
  * Trunk version of Docs/32bit contained updated comments for the SVC stack structure during ErrorV
  * Trunk version of s/HeapMan contained a tweak to try and reduce the number of small free blocks that are created
  * Trunk version of s/Kernel contained a change to only copy 248 bytes of the error string to the error buffer (down from 252 bytes), to take into account the extra 4 bytes needed by the PSR. However this goes against the decision that's been made in the HAL branch that the error buffer should be enlarged to 260 bytes instead (ref: https://www.riscosopen.org/tracker/tickets/201), so the HAL build will retain its current behaviour.
  * Trunk version of s/MsgCode had RMNot32bit error in the list of error messages to count when countmsgusage {TRUE}
  * Trunk version of s/PMF/i2cutils contained support for OS_Memory 5, "read/write value of NVRamWriteSize". Currently the HAL branch doesn't have a use for this (in particular, the correct NVRamWriteSize should be specified by the HAL, so there should be no need for software to change it at runtime), and so this code will remain switched out in the HAL build.

  Tested on Raspberry Pi

@Add new OS_PlatformFeatures reason code for reading CPU features (inspired by ARMv6+ CPUID scheme). Add OS_ReadSysInfo 8 flags for indicating the alignment mode the ROM was built with. Fix long-standing bug with OS_PlatformFeatures when an unknown reason code is used.
Detail:
  s/CPUFeatures, hdr/OSMisc, hdr/KernelWS - Code and definitions for reading CPU features and reporting them via OS_PlatformFeatures 34. All the instruction set features which are exposed by the CPUID scheme and which are relevant to RISC OS are exposed, along with a few extra flags which we derive ourselves (e.g. things relating to < ARMv4, and some register usage restrictions in instructions). s/CPUFeatures is designed to be easily copyable into a future version of CallASWI without requiring any changes.
  s/ARMops - Read and cache CPU features during ARMop initialisation
  s/GetAll - GET new file
  s/Kernel - Hook up the CPU features code to OS_PlatformFeatures. Fix a long standing stack imbalance bug (fixed in RISC OS 3.8, but never merged back to our main branch) which meant that calling OS_PlatformFeatures with an invalid reason code would raise an error, even if it was the X form of the SWI that was called. Similar fix also applied to the unused service call code, along with a fix for the user's R1-R9 being corrupt (shuffled up one place) should an error have been generated.
  s/MemInfo - Extra LTORG needed to keep things happy
  s/Middle - Extend OS_ReadSysInfo 8 to include flags for indicating what memory alignment mode (if any) the OS relies upon. Together with OS_PlatformFeatures 34 this could e.g. be used by !CPUSetup to determine which options should be offered to the user.

  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3
