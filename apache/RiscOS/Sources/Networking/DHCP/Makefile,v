@  Added build options for supporting broken Microsoft server software.
Detail:
  A new build option is present which, when defined in the Components file
    for a product, allows support for Microsoft's broken DHCP server to
    be included.  To use this, put options in the components file to set
    OPTIONS to be -DMINIMUM_OPTIONS_LENGTH=4 (the minimum allowed value is
    4.  The DHCP standard mandates this value should be no lower than 64).
    Microsoft server requires it to be 4 because it sends packets that are
    too short.
Admin:
  Not tested.
  Built.

@  Support for DHCPINFORM
  Dynamic leasing behaviour brought in line with DHCP specification
Detail:
  New *-command *DHCPExecute to enable CLI launching of DHCP interface
    control.
  Output of *DHCPInfo tidied up and irrevelant timer info is suppressed.
  The algorithm for deciding which offer to accept (where multiple offers
    are received) has been significantly enhanced (and moved to voting.c)
    If a previous offer from a server has been DHCPNAK'd by something else
    then the server offering the dodgy IP address is blacklisted and will
    no longer be preferred to a server which isn't blacklisted.
  DHCP module will request and prefer offers of an existing IP address
    configuration wherever possible.
  DHCP module will initialise an interface into the INITREBOOT/REBOOTING
    states if it is asked to take control of an interface which has
    already been configured externally.
  IP lease length suggestions are no longer sent in appropriate messages.
    The server is trusted to choose an appropriate value.
  The DHCP module is more careful to insert appropriate options into each
    message.  It is no longer in breach of RFC2131 in this respect.
  Timer values for renew and rebind times are now inferred automatically
    where necessary (server doesn't have to send them) and are now correct.
  DHCPRELEASE and DHCPDECLINE now include a textual message indicating the
    reason for the message's generation.
  Where allowed, outgoing messages contain a client class identifier to
    enable the server to vary configuration information depending on the
    client hardware/software type.  Currently, this information is the
    output of OS_Byte 0.
  In the SWI interface for examining DHCP packets, a pointer to a specific
    packet to examine may be supplied instead of an interface identifier
    (depending on a flag bit)
  New SWI DHCP_Inform for sending DHCPINFORM messages to arbitrary servers
    in order to enable retrieval of configuration information when the IP
    address has been established via other means (eg. from NVRAM).
  DHCP module is now capable of deleting IP addresses from interfaces.
  DHCP module will cede control of an interface if something else changes
    the interface's address and send a message to the server indicating
    that the lease is being relinquished.
  DHCP will trap the Internet (5.26 and later) module's panic service call
    when a duplicate IP address is detected on the network, and resolve
    the situation (send the server DHCPDECLINE and deconfigure the interface
    and restart address discovery) if it was controlling that interface.
  Transaction ID generation improved (uses interface MAC address to
    reduce chance of duplication with other hosts)
  MAC address discovery code added.
  DHCP module attempts to unicast packets wherever possible.
  Retry delays adjusted to conform more closely to spec (RFC2131)
  Possible hole in state table that IPConfig triggered which caused several
    DHCPDISCOVER messages to be sent in succession very quickly has been
    closed.
  Co-operates with Internet 5.26 to ensure that callers of the Internet
    module's BOOTP ioctl are returned sensible error values so that they
    no longer need to probe the DHCP module independently to discover
    whether an interface has been configured successfully or not.
Admin:
  Requires Internet 5.26
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.19

1.4
log
@  DHCP module behaviour when presented with a BOOTP response to one of
    its requests has been fixed.
Detail:
  If the DHCP module received a response from the BOOTP server rather
    than a DHCP server, it would discard the packet silently.  Since
    the Internet module only uses its own hooks into the UDP packet
    delivery code if no socket is bound to the BOOTP/DHCP port, the
    Internet module didn't see the response either.  This case is now
    trapped and delivered to the Internet module like a DHCPACK message
    would usually be (via sockets_transmit), except that we then forget
    about the interface to avoid having to deal with it any more.
  Fixed Makefile to use Do to call awk so that we can use the C library
    redirection and hence avoid getting lots of CRs in the header file
    which is exported to RiscOS.Export.C.h.DHCP
  Debug output on sockets_transmit altered to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL pointer when noting the DHCP message type of the packet being
    passed to the Internet module.

Detail:
  Blocking added to enable IPConfig to work correctly.
  Header file exported containing states and SWI identifiers.
  Brings loopback interface up so that it can bind to the DHCP client
    port (failure to have any AF_INET interfaces configured causes
    the bind() call to fail, even when INADDR_ANY is specified)
  Failure to read ARP cache now treated as a go-ahead to accept the
    IP address rather than a rejection.
  Keeps a copy of Internet BOOTP requests so that the options can
    be copied across to the DHCPDISCOVER if required.
Admin:
  Header export required by Internet 5.21 and IPConfig 0.15
  Requires Internet 5.21.
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.11.
  Requires IPConfig 0.15.
  Add module after all other expansion card networking modules and
    any attempt to BOOTP will be transparently upgraded to DHCP.
