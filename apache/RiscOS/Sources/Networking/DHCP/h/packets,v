@* Ignores DHCPACKS from incorrect servers.
* DHCP_GetOption and associated internal calls support sub-options and
  extended options.
* Random time intervals more uniformly spread.
* Time reports in *DHCPInfo were incorrect when real-time clock had changed
  since module initialisation.
* Server priority option supported.
* CMHG file optimised - syntax not duplicated.

@* Added initial delay in INIT-REBOOT state to match INIT state.
* Stopped extra DHCPREQUESTs being generated by ioctl calls in REBOOTING state.
* Don't reject BOOTP packets just because they don't have a cookie. Treat
  those without the correct cookie as containing no options.
* Reject BOOTP packets < 300 bytes, as per RFC 1542.
* Treat BOOTP responses in a more considered fashion - old versions would go
  nuts as soon as they saw any non-DHCP response. BOOTP replies now treated as
  (not very good) offers. BOOTP responses with correct address also accepted
  in REBINDING state.
* Decline DHCPACKs with no server identifier.
* Add server to blacklist if its offer ended up being DHCPDECLINEd for any
  reason.
* Add server to blacklist if we timeout requests.
* Initial boot delay now better randomised (seeded on MAC address), and in the
  range 1-10 seconds, as per RFC 2131.
* Corrected REBOOTING and REQUESTING back-off timers - first retransmission
  was too slow.
* DHCPREQUEST packets now have secs filled in correctly in REBOOTING state.
* Voting rules extended - prefer DHCP servers to BOOTP servers and prefer
  servers providing vendor options to those who don't.

log
@  Support for DHCPINFORM
  Dynamic leasing behaviour brought in line with DHCP specification
Detail:
  New *-command *DHCPExecute to enable CLI launching of DHCP interface
    control.
  Output of *DHCPInfo tidied up and irrevelant timer info is suppressed.
  The algorithm for deciding which offer to accept (where multiple offers
    are received) has been significantly enhanced (and moved to voting.c)
    If a previous offer from a server has been DHCPNAK'd by something else
    then the server offering the dodgy IP address is blacklisted and will
    no longer be preferred to a server which isn't blacklisted.
  DHCP module will request and prefer offers of an existing IP address
    configuration wherever possible.
  DHCP module will initialise an interface into the INITREBOOT/REBOOTING
    states if it is asked to take control of an interface which has
    already been configured externally.
  IP lease length suggestions are no longer sent in appropriate messages.
    The server is trusted to choose an appropriate value.
  The DHCP module is more careful to insert appropriate options into each
    message.  It is no longer in breach of RFC2131 in this respect.
  Timer values for renew and rebind times are now inferred automatically
    where necessary (server doesn't have to send them) and are now correct.
  DHCPRELEASE and DHCPDECLINE now include a textual message indicating the
    reason for the message's generation.
  Where allowed, outgoing messages contain a client class identifier to
    enable the server to vary configuration information depending on the
    client hardware/software type.  Currently, this information is the
    output of OS_Byte 0.
  In the SWI interface for examining DHCP packets, a pointer to a specific
    packet to examine may be supplied instead of an interface identifier
    (depending on a flag bit)
  New SWI DHCP_Inform for sending DHCPINFORM messages to arbitrary servers
    in order to enable retrieval of configuration information when the IP
    address has been established via other means (eg. from NVRAM).
  DHCP module is now capable of deleting IP addresses from interfaces.
  DHCP module will cede control of an interface if something else changes
    the interface's address and send a message to the server indicating
    that the lease is being relinquished.
  DHCP will trap the Internet (5.26 and later) module's panic service call
    when a duplicate IP address is detected on the network, and resolve
    the situation (send the server DHCPDECLINE and deconfigure the interface
    and restart address discovery) if it was controlling that interface.
  Transaction ID generation improved (uses interface MAC address to
    reduce chance of duplication with other hosts)
  MAC address discovery code added.
  DHCP module attempts to unicast packets wherever possible.
  Retry delays adjusted to conform more closely to spec (RFC2131)
  Possible hole in state table that IPConfig triggered which caused several
    DHCPDISCOVER messages to be sent in succession very quickly has been
    closed.
  Co-operates with Internet 5.26 to ensure that callers of the Internet
    module's BOOTP ioctl are returned sensible error values so that they
    no longer need to probe the DHCP module independently to discover
    whether an interface has been configured successfully or not.
Admin:
  Requires Internet 5.26
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.19

log
@  Fully functional DHCP client.
Detail:
  Implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (RFC2131 and RFC2132)
  This module usurps the Internet module's implementation of BOOTP in order
    to use the superior DHCP protocol.
Admin:
  Requires Internet 5.20 or later.
    (RiscOS/Sources/Networking/AUN/Internet  tag: Internet-5_20)
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.09 or later.
    (RiscOS/Sources/Libs/TCPIPLibs  tag: TCPIPLibs-5_09)
