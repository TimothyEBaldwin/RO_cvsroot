@Added -p switch to DHCPExecute command, that causes DHCP to assign
a private IP address in the event of DHCP discovery timing out.
Changed DHCP discovery timeout from 10 minutes to 20 seconds.

@  New -w option to *DHCPExecute
Detail:
  The -w option is similar to the -block option, except that it waits
    for the interface to appear if it is not already registered with
    the Internet module.  This means that the Internet Startup file
    no longer has to trigger callbacks after loading drivers in order
    to ensure that they are initialised enough for DHCP to start
    using them.
Admin:
  Tested softload on Risc PC.

@  Added options to *DHCPExecute.
Detail:
  *DHCPExecute now accepts two command-line options:
     -b (or -block)   Block until interface is bound
     -e               Set Inet$Error to any error
  Whilst in blocking mode, the module is idling with usermode_donothing
    and checking the Escape state, so you can press Escape to interrupt
    the process, although the module will still be attempting to bind
    the interface in the background.
  Ideally, InetSetup would be updated to know about the DHCP case and after
    ensuring the module, issue "DHCPExecute -e -b <interface>"
Admin:
  Tested in Risc PC - only affects Risc PC builds.
  Requires Library 0.28 or later (RiscOS/Library  Tag: Library-0_28)

log
@  Support for DHCPINFORM
  Dynamic leasing behaviour brought in line with DHCP specification
Detail:
  New *-command *DHCPExecute to enable CLI launching of DHCP interface
    control.
  Output of *DHCPInfo tidied up and irrevelant timer info is suppressed.
  The algorithm for deciding which offer to accept (where multiple offers
    are received) has been significantly enhanced (and moved to voting.c)
    If a previous offer from a server has been DHCPNAK'd by something else
    then the server offering the dodgy IP address is blacklisted and will
    no longer be preferred to a server which isn't blacklisted.
  DHCP module will request and prefer offers of an existing IP address
    configuration wherever possible.
  DHCP module will initialise an interface into the INITREBOOT/REBOOTING
    states if it is asked to take control of an interface which has
    already been configured externally.
  IP lease length suggestions are no longer sent in appropriate messages.
    The server is trusted to choose an appropriate value.
  The DHCP module is more careful to insert appropriate options into each
    message.  It is no longer in breach of RFC2131 in this respect.
  Timer values for renew and rebind times are now inferred automatically
    where necessary (server doesn't have to send them) and are now correct.
  DHCPRELEASE and DHCPDECLINE now include a textual message indicating the
    reason for the message's generation.
  Where allowed, outgoing messages contain a client class identifier to
    enable the server to vary configuration information depending on the
    client hardware/software type.  Currently, this information is the
    output of OS_Byte 0.
  In the SWI interface for examining DHCP packets, a pointer to a specific
    packet to examine may be supplied instead of an interface identifier
    (depending on a flag bit)
  New SWI DHCP_Inform for sending DHCPINFORM messages to arbitrary servers
    in order to enable retrieval of configuration information when the IP
    address has been established via other means (eg. from NVRAM).
  DHCP module is now capable of deleting IP addresses from interfaces.
  DHCP module will cede control of an interface if something else changes
    the interface's address and send a message to the server indicating
    that the lease is being relinquished.
  DHCP will trap the Internet (5.26 and later) module's panic service call
    when a duplicate IP address is detected on the network, and resolve
    the situation (send the server DHCPDECLINE and deconfigure the interface
    and restart address discovery) if it was controlling that interface.
  Transaction ID generation improved (uses interface MAC address to
    reduce chance of duplication with other hosts)
  MAC address discovery code added.
  DHCP module attempts to unicast packets wherever possible.
  Retry delays adjusted to conform more closely to spec (RFC2131)
  Possible hole in state table that IPConfig triggered which caused several
    DHCPDISCOVER messages to be sent in succession very quickly has been
    closed.
  Co-operates with Internet 5.26 to ensure that callers of the Internet
    module's BOOTP ioctl are returned sensible error values so that they
    no longer need to probe the DHCP module independently to discover
    whether an interface has been configured successfully or not.
Admin:
  Requires Internet 5.26
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.19

log
@  Integration with IPConfig completed.
  Header export added.
Detail:
  Blocking added to enable IPConfig to work correctly.
  Header file exported containing states and SWI identifiers.
  Brings loopback interface up so that it can bind to the DHCP client
    port (failure to have any AF_INET interfaces configured causes
    the bind() call to fail, even when INADDR_ANY is specified)
  Failure to read ARP cache now treated as a go-ahead to accept the
    IP address rather than a rejection.
  Keeps a copy of Internet BOOTP requests so that the options can
    be copied across to the DHCPDISCOVER if required.
Admin:
  Header export required by Internet 5.21 and IPConfig 0.15
  Requires Internet 5.21.
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.11.
  Requires IPConfig 0.15.
  Add module after all other expansion card networking modules and
    any attempt to BOOTP will be transparently upgraded to DHCP.

log
@  Fully functional DHCP client.
Detail:
  Implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (RFC2131 and RFC2132)
  This module usurps the Internet module's implementation of BOOTP in order
    to use the superior DHCP protocol.
Admin:
  Requires Internet 5.20 or later.
    (RiscOS/Sources/Networking/AUN/Internet  tag: Internet-5_20)
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.09 or later.
