@Makefile recreated from fragments
Renamed dhcpextern.h to DHCP.h so the shared makefiles can export it without needing a different source and target filename.

@Added -p switch to DHCPExecute command, that causes DHCP to assign
a private IP address in the event of DHCP discovery timing out.
Changed DHCP discovery timeout from 10 minutes to 20 seconds.

1.1
log
@  Integration with IPConfig completed.
  Header export added.
Detail:
  Blocking added to enable IPConfig to work correctly.
  Header file exported containing states and SWI identifiers.
  Brings loopback interface up so that it can bind to the DHCP client
    port (failure to have any AF_INET interfaces configured causes
    the bind() call to fail, even when INADDR_ANY is specified)
  Failure to read ARP cache now treated as a go-ahead to accept the
    IP address rather than a rejection.
  Keeps a copy of Internet BOOTP requests so that the options can
    be copied across to the DHCPDISCOVER if required.
Admin:
  Header export required by Internet 5.21 and IPConfig 0.15
  Requires Internet 5.21.
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.11.
  Requires IPConfig 0.15.
  Add module after all other expansion card networking modules and
    any attempt to BOOTP will be transparently upgraded to DHCP.
