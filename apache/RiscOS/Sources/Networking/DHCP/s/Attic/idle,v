log
@  Integration with IPConfig completed.
  Header export added.
Detail:
  Blocking added to enable IPConfig to work correctly.
  Header file exported containing states and SWI identifiers.
  Brings loopback interface up so that it can bind to the DHCP client
    port (failure to have any AF_INET interfaces configured causes
    the bind() call to fail, even when INADDR_ANY is specified)
  Failure to read ARP cache now treated as a go-ahead to accept the
    IP address rather than a rejection.
  Keeps a copy of Internet BOOTP requests so that the options can
    be copied across to the DHCPDISCOVER if required.
Admin:
  Header export required by Internet 5.21 and IPConfig 0.15
  Requires Internet 5.21.
  Requires TCPIPLibs 5.11.
  Requires IPConfig 0.15.
  Add module after all other expansion card networking modules and
    any attempt to BOOTP will be transparently upgraded to DHCP.
