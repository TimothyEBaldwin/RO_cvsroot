log
@Add SWI NetTime_States.
Makefile changed to use "CModule" fragment.
Soak up some compiler warnings.
Extralong functions removed.
Use central header files in preference to local defines.
A failure to register resources no longer leaves EventV and WordV claimed.

4.1
log
@Added a header file, debug.h, that is used to redefine some debuglib macros
if a non-debug build is being built. This is to allow the module to be built
on machines where debuglib is not present.

Validated by building both the old (v0.12) and new versions and ensuring that
the non-debug versions were identical. Also checked that the debug version
still built.
