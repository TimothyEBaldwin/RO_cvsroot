@Remove DST CMOS fiddling code.
Shortly to be handled by TerritoryManager, but the DST fiddling in this module was already broken. Aside from only knowing about Europe and Australia, the Australia rules were wrong too (since they've been changed again).
dhcp.c: use names for timezone CMOS rather than magic numbers.
Rework read_os_var() to remove the 'read length when buff = NULL' which is never used, but also wouldn't have worked because the read length call to OS_ReadVarVal returns an error which is caught by the _swix() hence you always got -1.
Put resolver variable name into a define in the header file.

@  Added Australian Rules DST.
Detail:
  * If NetTime$DST is set to Australian, instead of European, the
    Australian rules for daylight saving time are applied.
Admin:
  * Tested, and appears to work as expected.
  * Included documentation from Australian legislature detailing the
    changes for DST, and the special case for 2000. Not really required
    for projects at present, but useful to be correct nonetheless.
