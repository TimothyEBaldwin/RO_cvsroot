4.2
log
@  * Fixed all of the !Mk... files.
  * Now builds with the latest TCPIPLibs.
Detail:
  * All of the !Mk... files are required to pass TARGET into the makefile.
  * The new TCPIPLibs use the standard types.h from RISC_OSLib if it is
    available. This defines u_int32 types using int rather than long, which
    TCPIPLibs uses. Thus, NetTime needed a little tweaking to adjust for
    this change.
Admin:
  Builds.
  Requires TCPIPLibs-5_42 or later.

@If STB22 is defined, no attempts to use NVRAM are made. !MkSTB22
builds such a variant.
