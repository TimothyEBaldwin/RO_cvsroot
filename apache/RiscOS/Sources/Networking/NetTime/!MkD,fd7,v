4.5
log
@Add SWI NetTime_States.
Makefile changed to use "CModule" fragment.
Soak up some compiler warnings.
Extralong functions removed.
Use central header files in preference to local defines.
A failure to register resources no longer leaves EventV and WordV claimed.

4.4
log
@  * Fixed all of the !Mk... files.
  * Now builds with the latest TCPIPLibs.
Detail:
  * All of the !Mk... files are required to pass TARGET into the makefile.
  * The new TCPIPLibs use the standard types.h from RISC_OSLib if it is
    available. This defines u_int32 types using int rather than long, which
    TCPIPLibs uses. Thus, NetTime needed a little tweaking to adjust for
    this change.
Admin:
  Builds.
  Requires TCPIPLibs-5_42 or later.

@Precision of internal arithmetic and clock reading improved. Now possible
to maintain time to within a couple of milliseconds (given frequent enough
polling).

4.2
log
@  Added support for NTP, gradual time adjustment, configurable DST,
  and DHCP timezone.

Detail:
  If Inet$NTPServer is set, NetTime will use NTP (unicast SNTP, as per RFC2030).
  Otherwise it will use the UDP time protocol (it used to use TCP).

  NetTime will use the RTCAdjust algorithms to adjust the centisecond clock
  rate by +/-10% to get in step with the time server. By polling every 30
  minutes on a LAN, time will not deviate by more than 0.1 seconds once
  synchronised. It interoperates with RTCAdjust and the hardware RTC to ensure
  correct operation on a machine with RTC.

  NetTime has returned to polling every 30 minutes. This may defeat PPP
  timeouts - a suggested fix is to change PPP to only have TCP traffic keep the
  link up, or to have a separate user inactivity timeout (like Lazarus).

  The system variable NetTime$DST controls DST behaviour. Set to "European"
  (the default) to use European rules. Set it to something like
  "03-May-2000.01:00:00; 14-Sep-2000.01:00:00" to specify this year's start
  and end dates (in UTC). Set to "No" to make it leave DST alone.

  If a DHCP reply arrives while NetTime is loaded, it will check for the time
  offset option - if present, the timezone will be configured.

  New command *NetTime_Status gives information about the clock adjustments.

  NetTime attempts to start operation immediately on a non-dialup machine -
  removes the need for a *NetTime_Kick after softloading. *NetTime_Kick will
  still be required after, say, setting Inet$NTPServer manually.

Admin:
  Tested on desktop systems and STBs. NTP operation on an NC will require a
  way of finding out an NTP server - possibly redefining TIME_SERVER smartcard
  tag to be NTP? Anycast operation may also be worth adding.
