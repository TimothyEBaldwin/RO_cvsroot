@Make DNS lookup non-blocking:
  New state (DNSWait) and internal transition (DoDNS) added.
  Machine now support internal transitions, and DoDNS is injected by
  transitions that previously called tryconnect() to start lookup.
  State DNSWait polls resolver every second while it returns EINPROGRESS.
  Resolver interface (dns.c) taken from Acorn FTP fetcher.
