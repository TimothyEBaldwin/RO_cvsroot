log
@Import of BBE versions of certain components.
This is the result of executing the BBE build phase on a complete Tungsten
ROM build. It may be linked into any other compatible ROM builds in the same
way as if the source was available, but obviously it cannot be studied or
improved upon in its current form, and it is not portable to any incompatible
architecture variants or ABIs.
It is hoped that in future this will be replaced by a full source release.
