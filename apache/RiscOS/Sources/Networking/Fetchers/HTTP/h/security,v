1.1
log
@* https: support infrastructure has been added.  The API calls to the
  Internet module are now vectored through a look up table so that the
  calls for an https request are sent via the AcornSSL module.   The HTTP
  module will only register https: protocol capability with the URL
  module if the AcornSSL module is present, thus allowing transparent
  addition of SSL support without requiring an update for the HTTP
  module.

* There is no encryption code in the HTTP module at all.  It is all
  confined to the AcornSSL module.
