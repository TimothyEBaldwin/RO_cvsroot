@  Cookie header parser tweaked to strip redundant characters.
  Updated version number control to srccommit.
  AcornSSL version mismatch detection code added for safety.
  No longer enables event generation for HTTP sockets.
Detail:
  * Cookie parser was getting confused by a trailing ; character on
  the end of set-cookie headers being sent to it by the Electronics
  Weekly web server.  This meant that it was rejecting the key
  cookie being used to control access to the site thus preventing
  people from accessing the site.
  * AcornHTTP now checks that the AcornSSL module is implementing a
  known SWI interface (the AcornSSL SWI interface changed in 0.03)
  * No longer uses ioctl(..FIOASYNC..) to enable event generation as
  the events aren't required and it wastes system resource to have
  them going off.
  * Makefile contains rules for generating .i files suitable for
  feeding to the McCabe toolset.
Admin:
  Built from clean; tested on Ursula & 3.70; verified access to
  Electronics Weekly (www.electronicsweekly.co.uk) now works.
