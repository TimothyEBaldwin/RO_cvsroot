log
@  Cookie header parser tweaked to strip redundant characters.
  Updated version number control to srccommit.
  AcornSSL version mismatch detection code added for safety.
  No longer enables event generation for HTTP sockets.
Detail:
  * Cookie parser was getting confused by a trailing ; character on
  the end of set-cookie headers being sent to it by the Electronics
  Weekly web server.  This meant that it was rejecting the key
  cookie being used to control access to the site thus preventing
  people from accessing the site.
  * AcornHTTP now checks that the AcornSSL module is implementing a
  known SWI interface (the AcornSSL SWI interface changed in 0.03)
  * No longer uses ioctl(..FIOASYNC..) to enable event generation as
  the events aren't required and it wastes system resource to have
  them going off.
  * Makefile contains rules for generating .i files suitable for
  feeding to the McCabe toolset.
Admin:
  Built from clean; tested on Ursula & 3.70; verified access to
  Electronics Weekly (www.electronicsweekly.co.uk) now works.

@HTTP 0.82

* First block of data was being thrown on the floor during
  decompression in some cases.  This is now fixed.

* Debug output now knows about cookie related SWIs and won't claim that
  they are unknown SWIs.

* Transfers which are both Chunked and compressed work correctly now.

@AcornHTTP version 0.81

On the fly decompression now works.  Both deflated and gzipped files
are handled and will, if the server asks us to, be decompressed on the
fly during download.  (Chunked compressed downloads are untested)

log
@Single character cookie names weren't being accepted as valid.  They now
are.  This means that my.yahoo.com will now work properly (at least as
far as cookie support is concerned, anyway ;-)

Also fixed a bug that was yet to appear but that would have hit eventually
whereby you couldn't load more than 100 cookies from a previously saved
cookie file.

Security errors are thrown if one of the secure SWIs is called and the SSL
services are not available any more.

Several comments added to explain deviances from standards and why we need
them.

More fixes to portlist handling to allow parameter-less Port attributes to
work on cookies.

log
@* https: support infrastructure has been added.  The API calls to the
  Internet module are now vectored through a look up table so that the
  calls for an https request are sent via the AcornSSL module.   The HTTP
  module will only register https: protocol capability with the URL
  module if the AcornSSL module is present, thus allowing transparent
  addition of SSL support without requiring an update for the HTTP
  module.

* There is no encryption code in the HTTP module at all.  It is all
  confined to the AcornSSL module.
