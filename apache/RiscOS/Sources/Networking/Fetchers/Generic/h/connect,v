@  Modified to use DebugLib
Detail:
  Since these modifications were made before customising the code as the
    LDAP module, there seems little point doing that all again, so this
    is the latest DebugLib-enabled version of the generic fetcher.
Admin:
  Module builds and runs (albeit not doing anything much)

Version 0.08. Tagged as 'Generic-0_08'
