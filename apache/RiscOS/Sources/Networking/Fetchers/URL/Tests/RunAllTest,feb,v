1.1
log
@  Fixed crashes on URL_ParseURL 2 calls.
Detail:
  When rebuilding a URL object, the URL module would attempt to free()
    the pointers in the caller's URL block.  Since it didn't actually
    own these, this either caused somebody else's RMA to get freed or
    caused a "free failed" message to be output.  URL now takes a copy
    of the user data into its own buffers in order to rebuild the full
    URL.
  Increased the memory pool for URL_ParseURL 2 to 1024 bytes.
Admin:
  New test program (TestParse2) added to test this reason code.
  New script (RunAllTest) to run all the test programs.

Version 0.45. Tagged as 'URL-0_45'
