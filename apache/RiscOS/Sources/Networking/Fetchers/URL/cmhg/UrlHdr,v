@  No longer uses TinyStubs (due to __ctype)
  Extra ResourceFS files added for shared fetcher use.
Detail:
  TinyStubs usage for ROM builds removed due to library static data
    reference problems.
  Added code for direct SWI calling to protocol modules.  This code
    is switched out on the DIRECTSWI macro which is set in Makefile.
  RCS log tags removed from source files.
  New tests added to OddURLs test file.
Admin:
  Built from clean; tested in RAM build.

1.8
log
@Control characters are now hex-escaped when they are spotted by the URL
parser and resolver.  This stops URL users getting confused by spaces
in URLs amongst other things.

Two extra tests for this code have been inserted.  This module passes all
50 test cases.

Module now maintains its version number and date via srccommit

@URL 0.37.  The speedup code introduced in version 0.28 worked.  After a
minor change in 0.29, it stopped working and was using RMA for all
memory requests again and I didn't notice.  This is now fixed again,
and the 40* speed-up on URL resolves has returned!  The increase in
rendering speed of Browse is very noticable, as is the reduced startup
time when a large history is present.

log
@Scheme names are no longer expected to match entries in the Services
database, so they are no longer looked up there in an attempt to elide
the port numbers when canonicalising URLs.  A table of well-known scheme
to port mappings has been added, plus changes have been made to the way
protocol modules register to allow them to specify their port numbers.
