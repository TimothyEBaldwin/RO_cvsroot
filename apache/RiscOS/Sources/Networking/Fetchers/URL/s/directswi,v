log
@  No longer uses TinyStubs (due to __ctype)
  Extra ResourceFS files added for shared fetcher use.
Detail:
  TinyStubs usage for ROM builds removed due to library static data
    reference problems.
  Added code for direct SWI calling to protocol modules.  This code
    is switched out on the DIRECTSWI macro which is set in Makefile.
  RCS log tags removed from source files.
  New tests added to OddURLs test file.
Admin:
  Built from clean; tested in RAM build.
