log
@  Minor fault in URL resolver fixed (test cases added to test plan)
  Updated to use LocalRes
  Memory allocation for URL resolver increased to accomodate extra
  requirements for resolver fix.
Detail:
  Relative URLs using a // to replace everything but the scheme specifier
  didn't work.  They now do, plus a test in OddURLs checks that this is
  working.
  Memory pool size calculation altered to account for misaligned segments
  of URL to solve observed pool exhaustions on approximately 50% of
  resolves.  This was not fatal, as the memory allocator fell back to
  getting more chunks of RMA, but this can cause a severe performance
  penalty.
Admin:
  Built from clean; verified RAM build; verified resources exported OK.

@  No longer uses TinyStubs (due to __ctype)
  Extra ResourceFS files added for shared fetcher use.
Detail:
  TinyStubs usage for ROM builds removed due to library static data
    reference problems.
  Added code for direct SWI calling to protocol modules.  This code
    is switched out on the DIRECTSWI macro which is set in Makefile.
  RCS log tags removed from source files.
  New tests added to OddURLs test file.
Admin:
  Built from clean; tested in RAM build.

@Bug fix for looking up protocol as port number - which still looked it
up in most circumstances.  This lookup only occurs on unknown protocols
