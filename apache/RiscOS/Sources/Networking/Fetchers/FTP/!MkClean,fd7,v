log
@  Performance improvement.
Detail:
  Module disables Internet events for data connection sockets.
  Module sits on Event vector and processes sessions with data
    waiting on the control socket by calling FTP_ReadData with
    a zero length buffer so that any internal protocol handshaking
    can be done without the caller's involvement - this speeds
    up initial transaction stuff as the module no longer needs to
    be polled for data connection establishment to take place.
Admin:
  Tested in Risc PC.
