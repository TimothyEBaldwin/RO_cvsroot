@  Performance improvement.
Detail:
  Module disables Internet events for data connection sockets.
  Module sits on Event vector and processes sessions with data
    waiting on the control socket by calling FTP_ReadData with
    a zero length buffer so that any internal protocol handshaking
    can be done without the caller's involvement - this speeds
    up initial transaction stuff as the module no longer needs to
    be polled for data connection establishment to take place.
Admin:
  Tested in Risc PC.

@* We've had several reports of servers refusing to use passive connections
  for data sockets.  This is now cured by falling back to using PORT under
  the specific condition of a Permission Denied response to PASV.
  Full details in Docs/ImpDetails.
* Incresed the amount of work done per-ReadData call.  This improves
  performance by reducing the number of times the client has to poll
  for data.
* Module version number now maintained by srccommit.

@Directory listings now set an explicit title giving the URL to the
directory being listed instead of "FTP Directory Listing" - a title
which is useless if you want to store it in your hotlist.
