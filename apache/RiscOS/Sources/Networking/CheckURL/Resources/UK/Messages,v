@  New * command, tidying up.
Detail:
  *CheckURLAreas added; lists defined areas. Allocation pending. Tidied
  up module init code based on RTSP MB; removes need for module_kill
  finalisation code by using an atexit handler instead. Corrected typo
  in preamble text printed out by test program.
Admin:
  All tests still pass. Star command output is as expected for various
  area definitions or no areas at all. CMHG 5.30 or later required
  (enforced by Module.c).

Version 0.08. Tagged as 'CheckURL-0_08'

@  First complete version of Check URL.
Detail:
  Check URL allows applications to match URLs against URL fragments to
  perform domain, port and/or path specific activities. This could be
  used in a browser to block advert loading, in Video Control to select
  a protocol module, or in JavaScript to enable or disable the Pace VOD
  extensions, for example. See 2501,846 for details.
Admin:
  This has only been lightly tested, but I believe it's functionally
  complete according to issue 1 of the specification.
