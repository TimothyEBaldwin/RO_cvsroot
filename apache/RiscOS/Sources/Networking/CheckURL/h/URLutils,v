1.3
log
@  Bug fix in URL matching, two character error in source file header comments
  corrected.
Detail:
  Paths with colons in had those colons interpreted as port separators; the
  URL_Fetcher module only escapes chars 0-32 and 127 and I'd been relying on
  it doing other characters too. Whilst I was at it, I made the legacy
  support for a comma separated list of the match strings a compile-time
  option and compiled it out as CheckURL never uses this. In addition, every
  source file had a cut-and-paste propagated two character error in the
  source file header comments, which has been corrected.
Admin:
  Confirmed that ROM, RAM and debug builds compile. Tested various port
  and path combinations and modified test suite slightly to ensure that
  whilst ports work, colons in paths will work too.

1.1.1.1
log
@  First complete version of Check URL.
Detail:
  Check URL allows applications to match URLs against URL fragments to
  perform domain, port and/or path specific activities. This could be
  used in a browser to block advert loading, in Video Control to select
  a protocol module, or in JavaScript to enable or disable the Pace VOD
  extensions, for example. See 2501,846 for details.
Admin:
  This has only been lightly tested, but I believe it's functionally
  complete according to issue 1 of the specification.
