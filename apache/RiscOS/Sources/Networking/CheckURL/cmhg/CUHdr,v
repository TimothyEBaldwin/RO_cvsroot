log
@  New * command, tidying up.
Detail:
  *CheckURLAreas added; lists defined areas. Allocation pending. Tidied
  up module init code based on RTSP MB; removes need for module_kill
  finalisation code by using an atexit handler instead. Corrected typo
  in preamble text printed out by test program.
Admin:
  All tests still pass. Star command output is as expected for various
  area definitions or no areas at all. CMHG 5.30 or later required
  (enforced by Module.c).

@Seems to be a day for this kind of thing - SWI chunk base was wrong
in the CMHG file! Corrected.

1.1.1.1
log
@  First complete version of Check URL.
Detail:
  Check URL allows applications to match URLs against URL fragments to
  perform domain, port and/or path specific activities. This could be
  used in a browser to block advert loading, in Video Control to select
  a protocol module, or in JavaScript to enable or disable the Pace VOD
  extensions, for example. See 2501,846 for details.
Admin:
  This has only been lightly tested, but I believe it's functionally
  complete according to issue 1 of the specification.
