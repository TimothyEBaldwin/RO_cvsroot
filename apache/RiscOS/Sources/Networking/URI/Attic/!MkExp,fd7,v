1.2
log
@  Brought URI module up to date.
Detail:
  Sorted Makefile to have a dirs rule and export a URI SWI veneer (this
  was previously referred to as 'URILib'). Module gets version details
  from the VersionNum file now. Improved *command '*help' output. Got rid
  of redundant Service_Memory handler. Rewrote CMHG file. Added Docs
  and Utils directory, the latter holding Ben Laughton's transmit and
  receive tests - these used !Make-style Makefiles, which have been
  slightly updated to run in a more standard fashion but are still not at
  all pretty. They work though.
Admin:
  RAM and ROM builds (the latter just via. !MkROM directly) tested.
  Export tested. Both test programs built and tested.

Version 0.14. Tagged as 'URI-0_14'
