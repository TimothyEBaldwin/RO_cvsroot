1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of OmniNFS.
Detail:
  ANT sources unmodified; just converted to conform to our build structure.
  Some modifications should be made, in particular: 
    serverlist.c is currently compiled in pcc mode - should convert to ANSI
    module entry point declarations should be altered so that it actually
      builds with our version of CMHG.
Admin:
  Completely untested as it won't build properly yet.
