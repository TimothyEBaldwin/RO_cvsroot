@Cleanup pass
Callback.s copied from NetFiler (expands tabs, use Hdr:ModHand names)
Quit peeking kernel workspace, just use OS_ReadMonotonicTime since no uses of MONOTIME are in places where calling a SWI is prohibited.
Don't abuse InetDBase$Path, use InetDBase:
Use constants from Global/OsBytes.h and Interface/HighFSI.h
Use NFS SWI numbers from Interface/NFS.h (requires NFS-3_23 or later)
Get Omni constants from Interface/OmniClient.h

@  * Further rationalisations to fit into our build system.
  * Now builds.
Detail:
  * Altered to use auto-generated or centralised declarations, constants etc.
    whereever possible.
  * Altered to use some library routines instead of local equivalents.
  * Debug build uses DebugLib; different CMHG header for debug builds now
    generated using conditional compilation in preference to a completely
    separate CMHG file.
  * serverlist.c no longer built in pcc mode.
  * Internet event handler enables interrupts on entry and disables them again
    on exit.
  * Modified to use SrcCommit.
Admin:
  * Removed all files in hdr directory; assembler sources now use macros from
    HdrSrc.
  * Removed cmhg.OmniNFSDbg
  * Removed base.h and Base.s.
  * Removed builddate.h.
  * Requires AsmUtils.
  * Both builds compiled.

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of OmniNFS.
Detail:
  ANT sources unmodified; just converted to conform to our build structure.
  Some modifications should be made, in particular: 
    serverlist.c is currently compiled in pcc mode - should convert to ANSI
    module entry point declarations should be altered so that it actually
      builds with our version of CMHG.
Admin:
  Completely untested as it won't build properly yet.
