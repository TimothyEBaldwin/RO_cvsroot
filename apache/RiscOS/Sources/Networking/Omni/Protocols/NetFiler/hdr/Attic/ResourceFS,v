1.2
log
@Summary
  * Further rationalisations to fit into our build system.
Detail
  * Altered to use auto-generated or centralised declarations, constants etc.
    wherever possible.
  * Altered to use some library routines instead of local equivalents.
  * Debug build uses DebugLib.
  * Modified to use SrcCommit.
  * Got rid of warnings.
Admin
  * Removed entire contents of hdr directory; macros now obtained from HdrSrc.
  * Debug.h, ModuleWrap.h and Base.s removed.
  * Requires AsmUtils.
  * Both builds compiled.

Version 1.15. Tagged as 'NetFiler-1_15'

1.1.1.1
log
@Summary
  * Initial import of NetFiler.

Details
  * Revamped build structure.
  * Modified sources to use Desk instead of ANT's proprietary version of
    DeskLib; only uses linked list handling, SWI veneer and time code, so
    don't expect this shouldn't cause any significant problem.

Admin
  * Compiled.
  * Untested.
