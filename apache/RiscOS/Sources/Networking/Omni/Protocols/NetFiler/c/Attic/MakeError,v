@Internationalised
Add a Messages file, register this with the sprites from C (remove the assembler copy).
Internationalised the date in the Omni menu, and error strings from former MakeErrors.
Expanded the list of known machine types and look those up via Messages too.

@Makefile recreated from fragments
Untangle headers in the C source files.
Expand tabs in Resources.s, 32 bit a ^, and use Push/Pull macros.
Builds, but not tested.

1.2
log
@Summary
  * Further rationalisations to fit into our build system.
Detail
  * Altered to use auto-generated or centralised declarations, constants etc.
    wherever possible.
  * Altered to use some library routines instead of local equivalents.
  * Debug build uses DebugLib.
  * Modified to use SrcCommit.
  * Got rid of warnings.
Admin
  * Removed entire contents of hdr directory; macros now obtained from HdrSrc.
  * Debug.h, ModuleWrap.h and Base.s removed.
  * Requires AsmUtils.
  * Both builds compiled.

1.1.1.1
log
@Summary
  * Initial import of NetFiler.

Details
  * Revamped build structure.
  * Modified sources to use Desk instead of ANT's proprietary version of
    DeskLib; only uses linked list handling, SWI veneer and time code, so
    don't expect this shouldn't cause any significant problem.

Admin
  * Compiled.
  * Untested.
