1.1.1.1
log
@Summary
  * Initial import of NetFiler.

Details
  * Revamped build structure.
  * Modified sources to use Desk instead of ANT's proprietary version of
    DeskLib; only uses linked list handling, SWI veneer and time code, so
    don't expect this shouldn't cause any significant problem.

Admin
  * Compiled.
  * Untested.
