1.4
log
@Fix for renames where only the case has changed.
Detail:
 Added an extra check after the Xlate path resolution code so that
 the case of the path given to resolve is honoured. This now means that
 the strcmp() done in SMB_Rename fails and the rename is actually sent to
 the server. Before "*rename test Test" would have the path resolved and
 since 'test' already existed both names would be the same, in this example
 something like "*rename A:\test A:\test" would result.
Admin:
 Made the non LONGNAMES version compile again (not tested).
 Removed local definitions of FSControl reason codes, uses Interface header
 now.
 Made the case of #includes match CVS to allow future compilation on a case
 sensitive system.
 Deleted unused "Version" header.

1.3
log
@Tightened up checking of when sockets get opened and closed in an
attempt to work out why Freeway gets upset when LanManFS is
configured in IP mode.
Changed app date that OmniClient shows to be dd-mmm-yy
Added ability to include slimmer ROMSPRITES and deleted the resources
phase from the makefile: the sprites were being included once in
ResourceFS and again embedded in the module.
If the FS is unset it says so in *status rather than a blank line.

1.1.1.1.2.1
log
@  Check-in of all files comprising this development build of LanManFS
  Spaces in NetBIOS names are now allowed.
Detail:
  Now supports NetBIOS hostnames which contain spaces.  Use hardspaces
    in the Omni frontend or at the command-line (unless you can get
    away with a normal space without confusing the CLI parser)
Admin:
  Tested by attempting to connect to machines with spaces in their
    names.  Got the expected response from the target machine, so
    this aspect is working.
  It appears that several files did not get checked in due to datestamp
    problems when LanManFS's location in CVS was changed.  This is now
    fixed.
