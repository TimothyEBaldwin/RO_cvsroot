log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Fixed up a couple of trivial warnings with the stricter checking.
Removed OmniS_FastMultiply64 and rewrote the function in C, this allows the compiler to spot and use UMULL on architectures supporting that instruction.
Tested in a RAM build against a WinXP SP3 server with a drive > 4GB.

log
@  Multiple fixes.
Detail:
  Too many to list here: see doc/RPSChanges.
Admin:
  Received from Rob Sprowson approx 2009-02-08. Builds, but not tested by ROOL.

1.3
log
@Tightened up checking of when sockets get opened and closed in an
attempt to work out why Freeway gets upset when LanManFS is
configured in IP mode.
Changed app date that OmniClient shows to be dd-mmm-yy
Added ability to include slimmer ROMSPRITES and deleted the resources
phase from the makefile: the sprites were being included once in
ResourceFS and again embedded in the module.
If the FS is unset it says so in *status rather than a blank line.

1.2
log
@  Fixed bug in parsing of the protocol negotiation.
Detail:
  The wrong bit was being checked to see if we were using the extended
    security model (CAP_EXTENDED_SECURITY).  Thus the wrong format was
    being used in SMBsesssetup, which meant that we couldn't connect
    to Windows 2000.
  Much better debugging added to the name resolution code - this helped
    diagnose the faulty photocopier problem and is left in case anything
    like that happens again!
Admin:
  Tested - I can now connect to Win 2000 shares.

log
@  Fixed machine stiff if connection left idle too long.
Detail:
  SVC stack overflow occurred due to the recursive method used to
    discard the idle-out prevention responses.  This no longer
    happens.
  Fixed a bit of debugging which caused data aborts!
  Optimised a select() call to pass s + 1 as the first parameter to
    save Internet time in processing the fd_set.
Admin:
  Tested on desktop build, with the idle timers set to send idle outs
    every second (so we don't have to wait 100 hours for the problem
    to occur).  No longer get problems with the machine stiffing.
