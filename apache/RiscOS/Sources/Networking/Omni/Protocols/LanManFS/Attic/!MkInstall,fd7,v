1.2
log
@Tightened up checking of when sockets get opened and closed in an
attempt to work out why Freeway gets upset when LanManFS is
configured in IP mode.
Changed app date that OmniClient shows to be dd-mmm-yy
Added ability to include slimmer ROMSPRITES and deleted the resources
phase from the makefile: the sprites were being included once in
ResourceFS and again embedded in the module.
If the FS is unset it says so in *status rather than a blank line.
