@Fix for garbled translation
One too many %s's in the code, one too few in the messages file. This resulted in diagnostics messages (eg. at the bottom of *ListFS) to show a %s that hadn't got substituted.

log
@Get version number from messages file
Also, rationalise the two Omni_RegisterClient calls to both use _swix since they're virtually the same function repeated twice.

1.3
log
@Sync up the error messages
Due to an inability to count to 10 accurately, all the error tokens were wrong, leading to some inappropriate error messages.
Fixes problem "Message token E13 not found" when the SMB server gives a DOS error back.

1.2
log
@Wrap stats report in DEBUG switch
Missed in earlier internationalisation but spotted in the binary - the stats report function is only called from a debug command, but the linker wasn't spotting that and removing the table of stats names.
Translate the descriptive text in debug_err in RPC.c.
Retagged as LanManFS-2_41.

@Internationalised
Unused LMFiler put in the attic.
As LanMan has historically put its resources into ThirdPart/OmniClient this component has no ROM resources phase - it still registers the resources at run time.
