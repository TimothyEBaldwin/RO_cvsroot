1.2
log
@  * Further rationalisations to fit into our build system.
Detail:
  * Altered to use auto-generated or centralised declarations, constants etc.
    whereever possible.
  * Altered to use some library routines instead of local equivalents.
  * Debug build uses DebugLib.
  * Modified to use SrcCommit.
Admin:
  * Removed entire contents of hdr directory; macros now obtained from HdrSrc.
  * Contains assembler code that has 32 bit ARM 'issues' (TEQPs).
  * Requires AsmUtils 0.02 or later.
  * Both builds compiled.

Version 0.15. Tagged as 'Access-0_15'
