log
@OmniAccess brought up to date
* Makefile recreated from fragments
* 32 bit compatible (see support.s)
* Rewrote several pointless assembler routines in C
* Get defines from Interface/OmniClient.h, rather than local copies
* Internationalised
* Removed unused string header file
Tested sharing and unsharing some drives between a Risc PC (26 bit) and Titanium (32 bit, high vectors).
