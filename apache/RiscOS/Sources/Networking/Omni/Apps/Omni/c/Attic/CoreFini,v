1.3
log
@  * Fixed Omni$Running system variable bug introduced in previous revision.
  * Fixed bug where Quit->All in expert mode would only quit the filer and
    not the whole filing system.
  * Fixed bug where just quitting the filer and attempting to re-run OmniClient
    would produce the error "Some protocols in the mounts file are not
    available, and have been ignored".
  * Added resources and fleshed-out install phase.
Detail:
  * An internal error would be generated every time the Omni$Running system
    variable was read.  This was my fault, due to a change I made when removing
    the s.Base file in the previous revision .  The code variable block used
    to reference a location defined in s.Base, in which to store the generated
    string in.  I changed this to store it in the code variable block directly,
    but forgot to change an LDR to an ADR at the same time.

  * The application cleanup code was calling InitVars to reset global variables
    to their initial state, thus trashing the global_run_state variable which
    indicated that the entire filing system should be killed.  This was
    overly paranoid, as InitVars is always called on initialisation, which is
    perfectly adequete.  c.corefini removed as a result, as all it did was
    call InitVars.

  * The failure to restart cleanly on every 2nd attempt was caused by a
    horrible interaction between OmniClient's finalisation code, it's !Run
    file, callbacks and service calls.  It's too complicated to explain here,
    so if you're interested then ask me.  It's been hackily fixed for now by
    placing a call to Inet:Utils.TriggerCBs in Omni's !Run file, between the
    place where it kills the OmniClient module and reloads it (if it detects
    that the module is still running, but the task is not).  A cleaner solution
    should be implemented by making OmniClient able to restart its task in an
    intelligent manner, without requiring the module to be killed.

  * Previously, only Messages, Templates and Templates3D resource files were
    present, and nothing was done with them.  Added the remaining resources
    and fleshed-out the install phase to contruct the full application
    distribution instead of just copying the OmniClient module.

1.2
log
@  Several major bugfixes and further tidying to make Omni fit into our
  build environment better.
Detail:
  * Bug fix: ClientList function (Client.c) creates a textual menu desription
    for a list of clients (Info and Mounts submenus).  The description was
    generated on the stack and a pointer to it was returned.  The buffer is now
    static.
  * Bug fix: select or adjust clicks on the Omni icon just after it's loaded
    would kill the task part of Omni.  FilerCreate function (List.c) always
    calls FilerDelete, which would always attempt to close any existing filer
    window.  However, on the first call, no window exists so it passes the Wimp
    a 0 window handle.  This only appeared to happen on RISC OS 4, but I suspect
    this is to do with RISC OS 4's stricter protection of zero page.  Current
    fix is for FilerDelete to check if window handle is 0 before closing it;
    this is not very elegant - would be nicer to only call FilerDelete when the
    window was actually closed.
  * Bug fix: writable icon handling overhauled completely.  Many of the buffers
    which Omni would read the contents of writable icons into were too short
    to hold the maximum amount of text allowed in the icon.  New Icon_GetText
    call added (ExtLib.c) to allow Omni to work directly on indirected icon
    buffers wherever possible, thus removing the whole issue.
  * Stripped commented-out code from several places.
  * Changed use of Desk_bool to bool in most places.  This is a bit grim, but
    the way Desk_bool is implemented means you need to cast it in many places,
    which is even more grim.
  * Removed a few error assignements(!) because
    a) they weren't even being checked
    b) Desk's psuedo-exception system should now catch them
  * Got rid of home-grown strcasecmp calls and used Desk's instead.
  * Removed many local constants definitions and get them from system header
    files instead.
  * Removed Hdrs.h which would include *every* header file in *every* C file
    in the interests of compilation times.  C files now only include what they
    need.
  * Reimplemented the fully recursive Menu_Dispose along the lines of the
    non-recursive Desk_Menu_Dispose, which had changed since ANT's DeskLib
    split-off.
  * Altered quite a bit of code to prevent compiler warnings (mainly
    "use of '=' in condition context" and "variable declared but not used").
  * Uses 'proper' module finalisation instead of atexit in the interests of
    consistency and symmetry.
  * Added MemCheck support.
  * Reimplemented rma_alloc and rma_free in C (side effect of MemCheck support).
  * Altered assembler to use system header files instead of local ones.
  * Omni previously used a seeming random mixture of _kernel_swi and Desk_SWI
    SWI veneers.  All have now been changed to use _swix/_swi as appropriate.
  * Converted to use srccommit.

  Files removed:
   c.Error
   c.StrCaseCmp
   h.Debug
   h.Hdrs
   h.ModuleWrap
   h.OmniClient
   h.StrCaseCmp
   hdr.Macros

  Files added:
   Docs.DeskLibDiffs
   Docs.EventHandling
   h.Omni

  * Compiled.
  * All windows, menus checked to make sure they at least display.
  * Played around with a new NFS and LanMan mounts.
  * Basically, there shouldn't be any showstoppers, but the change from a very
    old DeskLib to Desk is a large one.  I'd be surprised if there aren't a
    few problems and this should definitely be thrashed a bit by people
    willing to do so before anyone has any confidence in it.

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of Omni into CVS.

Detail:
  This is an import of the sources obtained from ANT some time ago, with
  sufficient changes to allow it to build in our standard environment.  In
  particular, this involved converting Omni to use Desk instead of DeskLib.
  ANT's DeskLib was not 'off-the-shelf' - it was based on DeskLib 2.04 (very
  old), with their own modifications.
  
  This means that there are quite severe bugs in the Omni code, which will
  show up if you attempt to use this version, which were previously masked by
  some of ANT's DeskLib alterations.  (Hopefully) most of these have already
  been identified, fixed and will be checked-in soon.  I felt that a
  minimal version that would simply build would be worthwhile, so that as
  many changes as possible end up under CVS' control.

Admin:
  Compiled.
  Untested.
