@  * Fixed Bugzilla ID 21, where typing *RMKill OmniClient from the command
    line would cause the error "free failed, (heap overwritten)" if task part
    of the OmniClient module task was running at the time, rendering
    OmniClient unusable and unloadable until the next reboot.
  * Fixed Bugzilla ID 19, where killing a protocol module when OmniClient was
    already loaded would cause an "Invalid Wimp Operation In This Context"
    error.

  * Miscellaneous bug fixes and tidy-ups.
Detail:
  * The "free failed, (heap overwritten)" error is due to a bug in the
    SharedCLibrary, triggered by OmniClient calling getenv in the C library
    from its task.  The bug results from the implementation of getenv calling
    malloc - see Bugzilla ID 28 for further details.  This has been worked
    around by copying the C Library's getenv routine into OmniClient,
    renaming it to omni_getenv, and making all calls to getenv call
    omni_getenv instead; if the malloc happens from within the task rather
    than from within the C library, then things are fine.
  * The "Invalid Wimp Operation In This Context" error is caused by OmniClient
    calling Wimp_CreateMenu with R0=-1 from within the SWI handler that deals
    with protocol module deregistration.  The reasoning for this is that if,
    for example, you have the Mounts menu open, it becomes invalid at this point
    as all of the dying protocol module's mounts become unavailable.  However,
    it is not legal to call Wimp_CreateMenu at this point as you are not in
    your Wimp task context!

    The call to Wimp_CreateMenu has simply been removed.  This doesn't appear
    to cause a problem if you have a menu open with mounts belonging to the
    dying protocol module - attemping to perform an operation on one causes a
    sensible error to be reported.  A possible future enhancement would be to
    use OmniClient's pollword mechanism to cause the task to close any open
    menus on the module's behalf.

    The reason it never occurred before is that it used to call the X-bit-set
    form of the SWI and didn't check the error returned.  When I modified
    OmniClient to use Desk instead of DeskLib, I changed most SWI calls from
    the task part to be non-X-bit-set calls, and used Desk's psuedo-exception
    system to catch and report all errors at the top level of the
    application.

  * Uses AsmUtils to obtain Image$$RO$$Base.

  * Potential write through null pointer fixed in string duplication routines
    cpystr and cpyrma - they weren't checking the result of their allocation
    calls.

  * Replaced the somewhat confusing all_done variable, which could take (magic)
    values between 0 and 2 inclusive to cause different sorts of quit, with
    an enumerated type called RunState.

  * Issuing of Service_OmniClient (dying) in module finalisation made
    unconditional (was previously conditional on the value of all_done), as it's
    most definitely always dying if the finalisation routine is called.  I
    think this was a hangover from when the module finalisation code was
    implemented as an atexit handler.

  * Exit code in the task does not issue Service_OmniClient (dying) if the
    entire filing system is being killed off - this will happen in module
    finalisation, which will be called as a result of the task calling
    OS_ExitAndDie.  This can only happen in "expert" builds.

  * Fixed allocation of too much memory in ItemParse routine!  It dynamically
    creates an array of pointers to structures, but was allocating enough space
    for an array of structures.

  * Fixed potential memory leak in PrintListServers routine - was calling
    realloc and assigning the result directly to the original pointer, instead
    of assigning it to a temporary and only updating the original poiiner if
    the realloc succeeds.

  * Fixed potential null pointer dereference in SortMessages routine - had a
    check for a null pointer parameter at the start, but managed to dereference
    the pointer before the check as part of a variable initialisation.

  * Added all documents from ANT's Docs directory into ours.

@OmniClient filename translation specs		Revision 0.410, Nick, 18/11/94
======================================		COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL

Changes
-------

18-11-94:0.401 - 0.410:
   22:  Mention of case sensitivity-on flag
   87:  Details of case sensitive 'c' flag
16-11-94:0.400 - 0.401:
   19:	Mention that extension matches are case-insensitive
03-11-94:draft#3 - 0.400:
  all:  Large number of changes since syntax of file format has changed

Terminology
-----------

client-name	Name of OmniClient module (filing system name in fact)
extension	Alien filing system extension string. This DOES NOT
		include the separator string (eg, '/' or '.') and may be
		wildcarded, with '?' for a single character and '*' for
		multiple characters. Matches are case-insensitive, unless
		set to case sensitive by use of an optional flag.
filetype	RISC OS numeric filetype, given as hex (0x000-0xFFF)
                a special filetype of 0x9999 is taken to be the default
                to allow all other RISCOS filetypes to be mapped to a
                given extension string. &NNN is accepted as well as 0xNNN
flags		Optional flags for this mapping (see below)


File format
-----------

The file consists of sequence of blocks of mappings for a given client/
protocol module. For simplicity, the punctuation is kept to a minimum.
eg, no requirements for semi-colons, quotes, tagged fields, etc.

There is always a block with a client-name of 'default'. This provides
default mappings that a Client module can override by having a mapping
entry in its own block.

The mapping strings are prioritised using the order in which they appear
in the file. ie, the higher up in the file they appear, the higher the
priority. Hence a '*' wildcard will match everything if it appears first
in the file (which is not what you want!)

Comments can appear anywhere in the file (started by a '#' character),
and last to the end of the line. A new block of mappings for a different
client module is marked by a valid client name with no extra punctuation
(so that it cannot be confused with a file extension string).

If the client name is not registered at the time the file is parsed,
mappings following are skipped. This has the result that if the filetype
mappings file is parsed before client modules are loaded, then no mappings
can take place. The solution to this problem that OmniClient uses is that
every time a client module registers, the filetypes mapping file is 
reparsed. However, this only occurs once during startup - it is only if
client modules register at some later time that the file is reparsed.

Flags
-----

The flags string is optional for every mapping. It consists of a 
sequence of single characters, with no separators, that each relate to
a specific feature to turn on. The currently defined flags are;

  Flag char	Meaning
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  k		Keep file extension when Alien->RISC OS mapping. ie,
  		"READ.ME" can become "READ/ME" (type 0xFFF). The 
  		default action is to remove these extensions.
  s		Create a subdirectory when Alien->RISC OS mapping. ie,
  		"PROG.C" can become "C.PROG" (type 0xFFF). Note that
  		support for this flag is optional, and Client writers
  		may choose not to implement it.
  c		Extension matches are case sensitive (default is case-
  	 	insensitive). This would allow '.z' (gzip) and '.Z'
  	 	(compress) file extensions to be distinguished, for
  	 	example.
