@Fixed export phase and clean phase.

Detail:
  * Clean phase no longer generates (ignored) errors and actual errors.
  * Export phase no longer falls over
  * Removed some cruft relating to MemCheck
  * Added a stripdepnd to the !MkClean script - over-engineering
Admin:
  Tested briefly for Disc build.
Note:
  The export phase error from Make was completely misleading as it was
  quoting a completely wrong line number! I have no idea how it arrived
  at the line number it did for the "mal-formed suffix rule". The line it
  quoted happened to be in the middle of a bunch of suffix rules but these
  were totally unrelated - even if you commented the whole block out, it'd
  report that line as being the problem!! Doh.

@  * Fixed Bugzilla ID 21, where typing *RMKill OmniClient from the command
    line would cause the error "free failed, (heap overwritten)" if task part
    of the OmniClient module task was running at the time, rendering
    OmniClient unusable and unloadable until the next reboot.
  * Fixed Bugzilla ID 19, where killing a protocol module when OmniClient was
    already loaded would cause an "Invalid Wimp Operation In This Context"
    error.

  * Miscellaneous bug fixes and tidy-ups.
Detail:
  * The "free failed, (heap overwritten)" error is due to a bug in the
    SharedCLibrary, triggered by OmniClient calling getenv in the C library
    from its task.  The bug results from the implementation of getenv calling
    malloc - see Bugzilla ID 28 for further details.  This has been worked
    around by copying the C Library's getenv routine into OmniClient,
    renaming it to omni_getenv, and making all calls to getenv call
    omni_getenv instead; if the malloc happens from within the task rather
    than from within the C library, then things are fine.
  * The "Invalid Wimp Operation In This Context" error is caused by OmniClient
    calling Wimp_CreateMenu with R0=-1 from within the SWI handler that deals
    with protocol module deregistration.  The reasoning for this is that if,
    for example, you have the Mounts menu open, it becomes invalid at this point
    as all of the dying protocol module's mounts become unavailable.  However,
    it is not legal to call Wimp_CreateMenu at this point as you are not in
    your Wimp task context!

    The call to Wimp_CreateMenu has simply been removed.  This doesn't appear
    to cause a problem if you have a menu open with mounts belonging to the
    dying protocol module - attemping to perform an operation on one causes a
    sensible error to be reported.  A possible future enhancement would be to
    use OmniClient's pollword mechanism to cause the task to close any open
    menus on the module's behalf.

    The reason it never occurred before is that it used to call the X-bit-set
    form of the SWI and didn't check the error returned.  When I modified
    OmniClient to use Desk instead of DeskLib, I changed most SWI calls from
    the task part to be non-X-bit-set calls, and used Desk's psuedo-exception
    system to catch and report all errors at the top level of the
    application.

  * Uses AsmUtils to obtain Image$$RO$$Base.

  * Potential write through null pointer fixed in string duplication routines
    cpystr and cpyrma - they weren't checking the result of their allocation
    calls.

  * Replaced the somewhat confusing all_done variable, which could take (magic)
    values between 0 and 2 inclusive to cause different sorts of quit, with
    an enumerated type called RunState.

  * Issuing of Service_OmniClient (dying) in module finalisation made
    unconditional (was previously conditional on the value of all_done), as it's
    most definitely always dying if the finalisation routine is called.  I
    think this was a hangover from when the module finalisation code was
    implemented as an atexit handler.

  * Exit code in the task does not issue Service_OmniClient (dying) if the
    entire filing system is being killed off - this will happen in module
    finalisation, which will be called as a result of the task calling
    OS_ExitAndDie.  This can only happen in "expert" builds.

  * Fixed allocation of too much memory in ItemParse routine!  It dynamically
    creates an array of pointers to structures, but was allocating enough space
    for an array of structures.

  * Fixed potential memory leak in PrintListServers routine - was calling
    realloc and assigning the result directly to the original pointer, instead
    of assigning it to a temporary and only updating the original poiiner if
    the realloc succeeds.

  * Fixed potential null pointer dereference in SortMessages routine - had a
    check for a null pointer parameter at the start, but managed to dereference
    the pointer before the check as part of a variable initialisation.

  * Added all documents from ANT's Docs directory into ours.

  Tested on a Risc PC.

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of Omni into CVS.

Detail:
  This is an import of the sources obtained from ANT some time ago, with
  sufficient changes to allow it to build in our standard environment.  In
  particular, this involved converting Omni to use Desk instead of DeskLib.
  ANT's DeskLib was not 'off-the-shelf' - it was based on DeskLib 2.04 (very
  old), with their own modifications.
  
  This means that there are quite severe bugs in the Omni code, which will
  show up if you attempt to use this version, which were previously masked by
  some of ANT's DeskLib alterations.  (Hopefully) most of these have already
  been identified, fixed and will be checked-in soon.  I felt that a
  minimal version that would simply build would be worthwhile, so that as
  many changes as possible end up under CVS' control.

Admin:
  Compiled.
  Untested.
