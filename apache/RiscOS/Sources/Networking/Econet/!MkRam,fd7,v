@32-bit compatible
Detail:
  Added a veneer to the SWI handler so that internally they can corrupt flags and only on exit are 26 .v. 32 bit differences considered.
  No need to flags preserve the service call handler(s), module init, module finalisation.
  Fix bug in RxGetRegisters, the value in r9 pointing to the register block is a banked FIQ mode register, so the IRQ r13/r14 and SVC r13/r14 would be written whereever the unbanked r9 happened to be pointing. May also be worth considering adding a RxGetRegisters32 so the extra PSR fields can be read (not done).
  Changed references to ADR rN, IOC to MOV rN, #IOC.
  For OS_Byte calls use names from Hdr:OsBytes.
  Fix for lock up in SetTicker. If Service_ClaimFIQ were to return an error, the function returned without re-enabling interrupts. Extra PLP inserted.
  Removed manual NOPs after PSR fiddling macros, these are now included in the macro where required with HdrSrc-2_63.
  Delete many unused macros from Macros.s to save having to bother 32 bitting them.
  Made 32 bit write of processor vector (required in a 32 bit configuration on a 26 bit system) conditional on :LNOT:No32bitCode, so it's omitted for machines without MSR/MRS.
Admin:
  Submission from Ian Bradbury, with input from Rob Sprowson.
  Tested with AEH60 NIC on Risc PC with RISC OS 3.71, 4.02, 5.22.
  Tested using motherboard Econet module with RISC OS 3.10 on an A5000.
  For RISC OS 5, requires Podule-1_71 for the NIC address lookup, and also hardwiring a different IOC address (this is not currently looked up at runtime).

@Add support for RAM variant
Now we use the shared makefiles & accept MessageTrans is present, we get a RAM variant with merged messages almost for free. Add the supporting ResourceFS register/deregister code, this removes the need for a separate EconetMsgs module.
Tested on a RISC OS 3.70 Risc PC with AEH60 card, browsing a server & copying files to and fro.
