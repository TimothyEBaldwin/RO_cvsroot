4.2
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Moved NewOS/OldOS switches into Econet.s.
Updated line labels in SetStn utility to have non-autogenerated names.
Note: as a result of simplifying the Makefile, it is no longer possible to build an EconetMsgs module.

Binary identical, not tested. Tagged as Econet-5_76-pre1.
