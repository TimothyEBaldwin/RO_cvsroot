@Import of AccessCD sources
Recovered from archive disc 0284,804 these are the sources to !AccessCD, only the installed copy of which previously made it into CVS.
AccessCD is abandoned, since CDFS now buffers data itself up to 512k. Also, the CDCache module sources are lost.
Doesn't build, for archive purposes only.
