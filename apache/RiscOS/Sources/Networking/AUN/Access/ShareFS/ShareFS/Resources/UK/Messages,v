@Fix for zero page fault in MessageTrans when IP address changes
Detail:
  The errno lookup function was also including the last OS error, but not
checking if there actually was an OS error, leading to an address of
&00000004 being passed to MessageTrans to substitute.
  Since the C library (and TCP/IP library) errors aren't in the same number
space, just remove this unrelated text from the function and say "Network
error" instead.
  Also modified errno lookup to get the message token right for errors > 99.
Admin:
  Submission from Rob Sprowson.
  Binary built using All32 environment & cc 5.71.
