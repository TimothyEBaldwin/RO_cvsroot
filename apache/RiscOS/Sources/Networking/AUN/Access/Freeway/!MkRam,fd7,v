4.1
log
@Have Freeway look after its own messages
Remove faulty logic for Service_MessageFileClosed, MessageTrans reopens the file, so no need to do it again locally.
Usual register/deregister/reregister code for ResourceFS.
Replace clumsy casts of (_kernel_oserror *)0 with NULLs.

Version 0.39. Tagged as 'Freeway-0_39'
