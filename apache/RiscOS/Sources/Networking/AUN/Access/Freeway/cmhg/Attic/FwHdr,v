@Makefile recreated from fragments
Usual drill
* Rename CMHG file to be the auto generated one
* Cast away some warnings
* Swap a few header files around, use defs from central headers where available
Also, add hdr/Freeway which in turn will be exported and end up in <swis.h>.

Participated in a ROM build, but not functionally tested.

@Fix from Kevin for keeping tabs on when the message file block is
valid (all those free()s added in 0.33 meant the RMA got shuffled
and when a message was required caused an abort in MessageTrans).
Added "date-string" to CMHG file.
More stringent checking on socket closing,in some circumstances with
LanManFS set to IP mode Freeway would try to reinit but gave up as
it found only one socket open - trouble is it was Freeway's fault for
only closing one of them.

@  - Added command to add a remote subnet.

Detail:
  Freeway will interrogate an AUN server to discover subnets on which it
should broadcast.  However there was no other way to explicitly add another
subnet on which freeway should broadcast.

  The new *command FWAddnet will do this.  This allows ShareFS to talk to a
RISC OS machine on a different subet, e.g. between an STB and a RiscPC on the
engineering and house networks.  If the intervening router doesn't allow
directed broadcasts (as is quite often the case), you can specify a specific
host on the other network.

Admin:
  Tested on a DSL4000 and RiscPC on the house and engineering networks.

@  Much tidying up, and support for new CMOS bit to prevent Freeway setting
    default addresses on interfaces.
Detail:
  Removed obsolete source files and headers.
  CMHG file pulls in details from global header files and VersionNum.
  CMHG uses proper veneers for functions and generates the header file
    for module.c to relieve it from having to mis-declare the veneer
    functions.
  Debugging is now entirely DebugLib based.
  Fixed short buffer which would cause the machine to die with aborts
    if an error message was just a bit too long for it.
Admin:
  Requires HdrSrc-0_28 or later.
  Tested in Ursula ROM build.

log
@Unfortunately, this logs changes that were made some time ago.

Added facility for clients to register a descriptive string for a type.
(Printers are still special cased, since I've not modified the client code).
Added support for use of a single point to point interface.

Removed local copies of standard library functions, and linked against
library instead.
