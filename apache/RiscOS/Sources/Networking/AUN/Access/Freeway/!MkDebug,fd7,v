4.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Usual drill
* Rename CMHG file to be the auto generated one
* Cast away some warnings
* Swap a few header files around, use defs from central headers where available
Also, add hdr/Freeway which in turn will be exported and end up in <swis.h>.

Participated in a ROM build, but not functionally tested.

Version 0.37. Tagged as 'Freeway-0_37'
