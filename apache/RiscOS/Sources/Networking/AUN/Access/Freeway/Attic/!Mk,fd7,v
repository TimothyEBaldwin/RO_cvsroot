4.2
log
@Have Freeway look after its own messages
Remove faulty logic for Service_MessageFileClosed, MessageTrans reopens the file, so no need to do it again locally.
Usual register/deregister/reregister code for ResourceFS.
Replace clumsy casts of (_kernel_oserror *)0 with NULLs.

Version 0.39. Tagged as 'Freeway-0_39'

4.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Usual drill
* Rename CMHG file to be the auto generated one
* Cast away some warnings
* Swap a few header files around, use defs from central headers where available
Also, add hdr/Freeway which in turn will be exported and end up in <swis.h>.

Participated in a ROM build, but not functionally tested.
