4.2
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Usual drill
* Rename CMHG file to be the auto generated one
* Cast away some warnings
* Swap a few header files around, use defs from central headers where available
Also, add hdr/Freeway which in turn will be exported and end up in <swis.h>.

Participated in a ROM build, but not functionally tested.

4.1
log
@  Much tidying up, and support for new CMOS bit to prevent Freeway setting
    default addresses on interfaces.
Detail:
  Removed obsolete source files and headers.
  CMHG file pulls in details from global header files and VersionNum.
  CMHG uses proper veneers for functions and generates the header file
    for module.c to relieve it from having to mis-declare the veneer
    functions.
  Debugging is now entirely DebugLib based.
  Fixed short buffer which would cause the machine to die with aborts
    if an error message was just a bit too long for it.
Admin:
  Requires HdrSrc-0_28 or later.
  Tested in Ursula ROM build.
