@Have Net look after its own messages
Net was trying to share some messages with the Econet module, though on balance this wasn't particularly useful as it then needed to duplicate message handling code to keep 2 files open. Because those messages were held in AUNMsgs they didn't get tokenised in ROM, overall ending up taking more space.

Register in ResourcesFS at run time for RAM targets, add tokenisation directives for ROM targets, removed redundant !Configure related strings.
Changed the messages fd to be int's to ensure word alignment.
Removed inappropriate Service_MessageFileClosed handler, MessageTrans reopens the files (since the fd is in the RMA) so no need to reopen them a second time. This service call is intended to recache direct pointers to tokens, but none are ever taken.
Save time by just making textbuf a zero length string rather than memset()ing the whole buffer.
Resolved a couple more compiler warnings (but NetG still doesn't compile).
Fix bug where a failure to enable the internet event would decrement the internet event count for any other modules interested in that event.
Use CMHG finalisation rather than atexit().
Error "AUN not configured" now uses a non zero trappable error number.
Error number for BadSWI corrected from 0x111 to 0x110.

Requires HdrSrc-2_51 for the error number.

Version 6.25. Tagged as 'Net-6_25'
