log
@Added Econet's messges file to AUNMsgs resources, as a part of the dropping of
support for Econet : it is no longer necessary to have the Econet module
present in order to be able to use the AUN software (Net, NetI), since these
use some of the messages within the Econet messages file.
Initially, this is to support Ursula, but by keeping to a single version of
the networking software, support issues are simplified.
