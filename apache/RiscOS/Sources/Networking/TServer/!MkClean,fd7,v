@  A telnet server for RISC OS

Details:
  This is a simple telnet server for RISC OS.  It supports a subset of the
telnet protocol but has hooks to extend it if desired.

  One connection at a time is supported, a second connection will kick off the 
first one.

Admin:
  Used extensively on the Customer L development board.  Doesn't have a ROM build
rule at the moment.
