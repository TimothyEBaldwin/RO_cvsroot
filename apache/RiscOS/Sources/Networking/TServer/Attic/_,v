@  This is a simple telnet server.

Details:
  There was no source for a telnet server in the repository, we only had
binaries.  For development work on embedded systems it is very useful to have
a command line interface, this component serves that purpose.

  A limited subset of the telnet protocol is supported, with hooks to extend it
if necessary.  At the moment it supports one connection at a time, attempting
to connect again will kick off the existing connection.

Admin:
  Used quite extensively on the Customer L development board.  Doesn't have a ROM
build option at the moment

Details:
  This is a simple telnet server for RISC OS.  It supports a subset of the
telnet protocol but has hooks to extend it if desired.

  One connection at a time is supported, a second connection will kick off the 
first one.

Admin:
  Used extensively on the Customer L development board.  Doesn't have a ROM build
rule at the moment.
