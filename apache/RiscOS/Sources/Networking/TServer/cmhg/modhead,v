@Commit of latest TServer from Dan Ellis:
> Here's some changes I made to tserver which allow it to respond on
> callbacks rather than just using a taskwindow. A taskwindow is only fired
> up when upcall application started occurs, so otherwise the command
> executes int the background.
>
> There's a new *command to give taskwindow which executes a *command at an
> address in memory (TServer_OSCLI) this allows just a single command to be
> executed by the taskwindow (the one which was being executed on the
> callback), then the taskwindow quits.
>
> This might prove a good point to add authentication.
>
> There's a bit of cruft in there as well, e.g. some debug stuff for
> reporting when I file has changed.
>
> Also, I think you might not have the code which restricts the size of the
> terminal from the remote machine. This is good for directory listings, so
> that they come out well formatted.

@  - task closedown cleaned up
  - media not present upcall trapped
  - VDU processing much enhanced
  - task quit fixed

Detail:
  The stack claimed from RMA is now released on Service_WimpCloseDown rather
than on exit.  This means it also gets released if the program exits
abnormally.  Service_WimpCloseDown also resets the task handle, so that if
the Wimp exits and restarts, TServer will restart as well, previously it was
failing to do this because it hadn't reset its task handle.

  There was a problem with media not present error boxes popping up, for
example when an attempt was made to access an unavailable share. This has
been fixed by sitting on UpCallV and cancelling it if the current task is one
of ours (determined by calling Wimp_ReadSysInfo).  This results in an
immediate response of 'shared disc not available' which is quite
satisfactory.

  Additional VDU Sequences now understood:

  6 and 21 turn on and off VDU output (control whether anything gets written
to the socket)

  17 sets foreground and background text colour

  30 homes the cursor

  31 tabs the cursor to position x, y.

  Multibyte VDU sequences other than these aren't eaten at the
moment.

  Task quit wan't being listened to.  Typing ShellCLI_TaskQuit in a session
will now quit it cleanly.  (you may like to alias this to something a little
easier to type!).

Admin:
  Tested extensively on RiscPC and STB3.

@  (this time with the cmhg file)
  Added clear screen to VT commands known.
  Added TServer_VTCommand

Detail:
  The server didn't understand clear screen.  This is quite nice to have.

  There is now a way of sending generic VT control sequences using the
TServer_VTCommand *command.  This prefixes the string with the escape
character e.g. TServer_VTCommand [A will send '\x1b[A' to the terminal and
cause the cursor to go up one line.

  Tested RiscPC.

@  - Now uses no wimpslot so can just be run
  - Now supports multiple telnet sessions

Detail:
  Previously the module had to be started with *desktop so that it was
started with the service call mechanism in order that the wimpslot could be
explicitly set.  Since the only memory required for C is for the Stack,
this is allocated in RMA.  Internal memory allocation is done from the RMA
explicitly.

  This enables the module to be run simply by double clicking on it rather
than having to start it's Task part separately, a technique used by ShareFS,
and maybe of use in other components.

  There is now support for multiple telnet sessions.  Previously only one was
supported at a time.  If debugit output is switched on, it will be displayed
in the last session opened.

Admin:
  Tested on a RiscPC.

log
@  Added debugit support.

Detail:
  The debugit module is one of the options for output from Debuglib.  It
buffers output and will set a pollword for an app to display the output at an
opportune time, !ListDebug is the standard handler for this.

  For embedded work it is useful for debug output to come out in the terminal
window on which you are working, since you may not have !Listdebug running on
the client and you probably don't want it to be displayed on the device
anyway.  Issuing the command TServer_DebugItStart will register the
application part of TServer with the DebugIt module, and send debugit output
back across the socket to the telnet terminal being communicated to.

  This provides a capability not available with normal taskwindows - you
can't run a program with debuglib and get output in the taskwindow because
the module producing the output has no idea which taskwindow to output the
debug data to, running from the command prompt you can achieve this as the
machine is then no longer multitasking and you can use printf debuglib
output.  TServer debug output is very similar to this.

  There is a complementary command, TServer_DebugitStop which deregisters
TServer from debugit.

Admin:
  Tested extensively on the Customer L SDB.  If a lot of debug output is
generated, it can get choked, although it usually seems to come through.

@  A telnet server for RISC OS

Details:
  This is a simple telnet server for RISC OS.  It supports a subset of the
telnet protocol but has hooks to extend it if desired.

  One connection at a time is supported, a second connection will kick off the 
first one.

Admin:
  Used extensively on the Customer L development board.  Doesn't have a ROM build
rule at the moment.
