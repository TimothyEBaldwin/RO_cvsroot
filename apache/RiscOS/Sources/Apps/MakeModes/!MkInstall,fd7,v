1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
We don't bother installing the GenModes subdirectory since MakeModes doesn't use it itself, and it was only ever a stale copy of the modes supplied in BootResources:Configure.Monitors anyway, so let's make those the master set.
MakeModes.c:
  Be case sensitive when constructing the path, just incase the FS is.
makemodes.h:
  Delete some dead definitions.
Built, and briefly tested.

Version 0.30. Tagged as 'MakeModes-0_30'
