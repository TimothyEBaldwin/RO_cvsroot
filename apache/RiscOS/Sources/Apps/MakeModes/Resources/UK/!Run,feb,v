log
@  Rebuildable version of MakeModes.
Detail:
  Application had languished horribly, and seemed to have acquired CR+LF
  line endings everywhere, apart from other ills. I fixed this ages ago
  but forgot to check it in. This should build on an Iyonix under a normal
  build environment and produce a working 32-bit version.
Admin:
  Not tested much - did produce a mode definition or two with it. Seems to
  work as I remember it should on a Risc PC. This does NOT contain Iyonix
  timings - it's still expecting VIDC20.

Version 0.27. Tagged as 'MakeModes-0_27'

log
@Found under an old piece of carpet - V0.26 of !MakeModes.
To see the original sources (and previous 5 versions) see 2504,066 - this
is a semi tidied up versin.Well,the directories are vaguely right.
