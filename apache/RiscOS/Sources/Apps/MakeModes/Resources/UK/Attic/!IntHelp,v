1.3
log
@Removed DOS line endings.
Was causing lots of errors trying to load or generate new MDFs, they should be Acorn (or Unix) line endings.
Fixed warning about accessing beyond the vidc_bandwidth_limit array, was causing some Type=5 explosions.
Made the info box get its version number from VersionNum by processing the messages file.
Adjusted the recursive copy of resources so you don't end up with two lots of everything in the install directory.
Tested briefly - creates new files and explodes less.

1.2
log
@  Rebuildable version of MakeModes.
Detail:
  Application had languished horribly, and seemed to have acquired CR+LF
  line endings everywhere, apart from other ills. I fixed this ages ago
  but forgot to check it in. This should build on an Iyonix under a normal
  build environment and produce a working 32-bit version.
Admin:
  Not tested much - did produce a mode definition or two with it. Seems to
  work as I remember it should on a Risc PC. This does NOT contain Iyonix
  timings - it's still expecting VIDC20.
