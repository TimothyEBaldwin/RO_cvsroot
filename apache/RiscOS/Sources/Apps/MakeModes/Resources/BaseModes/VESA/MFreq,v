1.2
log
@Removed DOS line endings.
Was causing lots of errors trying to load or generate new MDFs, they should be Acorn (or Unix) line endings.
Fixed warning about accessing beyond the vidc_bandwidth_limit array, was causing some Type=5 explosions.
Made the info box get its version number from VersionNum by processing the messages file.
Adjusted the recursive copy of resources so you don't end up with two lots of everything in the install directory.
Tested briefly - creates new files and explodes less.

Version 0.29. Tagged as 'MakeModes-0_29'

@Found under an old piece of carpet - V0.26 of !MakeModes.
To see the original sources (and previous 5 versions) see 2504,066 - this
is a semi tidied up versin.Well,the directories are vaguely right.
