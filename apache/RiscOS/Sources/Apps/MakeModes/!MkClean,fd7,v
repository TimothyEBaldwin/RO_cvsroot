1.1
log
@  Rebuildable version of MakeModes.
Detail:
  Application had languished horribly, and seemed to have acquired CR+LF
  line endings everywhere, apart from other ills. I fixed this ages ago
  but forgot to check it in. This should build on an Iyonix under a normal
  build environment and produce a working 32-bit version.
Admin:
  Not tested much - did produce a mode definition or two with it. Seems to
  work as I remember it should on a Risc PC. This does NOT contain Iyonix
  timings - it's still expecting VIDC20.
