@* WebServe 0.48 - tagged as sbrodie_WebServe_0_48.  Version number jump
  from 0.45 to avoid confusion with some test builds still circulating.

* Updated required version numbers in !Run file
* Added new configuration variable to set the name of the default page
  so people can change it from "Home" to something else (or even a list
  of things)
* Added code to use FileWatch to keep an eye on changes to the Serve
  directory with a view to re-indexing it.  This code is still switched
  out (macro FILEWATCH needs to be defined in c.serve)
