log
@* WebServe 0.48 - tagged as sbrodie_WebServe_0_48.  Version number jump
  from 0.45 to avoid confusion with some test builds still circulating.

* Updated required version numbers in !Run file
* Added new configuration variable to set the name of the default page
  so people can change it from "Home" to something else (or even a list
  of things)
* Added code to use FileWatch to keep an eye on changes to the Serve
  directory with a view to re-indexing it.  This code is still switched
  out (macro FILEWATCH needs to be defined in c.serve)

@Deferred cache load/validation added.  When WebServe starts, it does
not scan the entire cache in order to validate it and extract all the
object information.  The loading of information for any given host is
deferred until a client first asks for an object from that site.  As a
result, startup time is much improved (no more sitting around for
minutes when the cache is large) and time to load the cache almost
unnoticable as the time taken to load each host is small and these do not
happen in one go.
