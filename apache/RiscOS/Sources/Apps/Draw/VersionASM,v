@Edit UTF-8 text in text entry with backspace correctly
On starting a new string using the text entry tool, cache the current alphabet, then when backspace is pressed handle deletes properly when the alphabet is UTF-8 by skipping over continuation marks until a non continuation mark is found.
The backspace code can afford to be simplistic because any invalid UTF-8 sequences already in the file when it is opened will end up (via Ctrl-E) in a Wimp writeable, which is handled by the Wimp's robust code. Only newly created strings are able to have backspace applied, so by definition they were entered just moments earlier, and so reasonable to assume they're valid UTF-8.

Having entered a string, get the bounding box right by calling Font_ScanString rather than manually walking the string with Font_CharBBox (Font_ScanString was already being used for transformed text, so rotated bounding boxes were right). Now the two are common, make a font_scanstring() function to handle both.

This could be further simplified by just editing existing strings in place, see ticket #426.

@Fix for abort when dragging an unknown filetype to Draw, and a bogus error message
Various places in Draw were making an error block (via makmsg or retmsg macros) from a cast pointer using the msg part of RISC_OSLib. However, as RISC_OSLib caches the messages file and returns direct pointers to it, the resulting error blocks would often not be word aligned, leading to an abort when the Wimp tries to copy it for the Wimp_ReportError.
In turn, the abort would be reported as unhelpful "wimpt1" message because the signal handler was looking it up in the application messages, not the default RISC_OSLib messages.
Draw.c:
New function top copy the msg to a word aligned static struct.
Fix signal handler to use msgs_default_control_block() so that "wimpt1" can be found.
Draw.h/others:
Replace makmsg and retmsg with calls to the new aligning function.

Tested by dragging a GIF and a BMP to Draw, and it no longer aborts.

@Pop to top a draw file if already open rather than loading again
As for !Edit and the filer, when asked to open the same thing a second time, just re-present the one already in memory rather than opening a second time.
We borrow the logic from !Edit - the (uncanonicalised) filename must be the same, unmodified, with the same datestamp. If all these are true just pop the existing window (or newest of the views when multiple views exist) to the top.

Draw.c:
Change the boolean expression at line 2191. While previously correct (not wimp_MDATALOAD does include wimp_MDATAOPEN) it subsequently relied on load_file to skip wimp_MDATASAVE.
DrawFileIO.c:
Add check of load/exec/modified/filename. Defer creating a new diag until later on to avoid annoying screen flicker when disposing of the diag (similarly for error cases).
Fix confusion returning FALSE as a pointer.

@Add support for background blended text and text areas
The background colour for text can now be set to "none" in the colour picker to request Draw to blend to background, rather than a fixed colour.
In the saved file 0xFFFFFFFF, or -1, is used (same as foreground colour transparent) which would render gracefully as a white background on older versions of !Draw.
For text areas the \B and \C commands can use -1 -1 -1 for the RGB components to denote transparency (3 arguments are defined as required in the text area spec, even though only 1 would really be needed).
When text in a text area has a foreground colour of 'transparent' no text is plotted, this is to be consistent with the behaviour for ordinary text.
Reordered the 'Enter' submenu to have the tools listed in the same order that they appear in the tools pane.
Moved MIN/MAX macros into common header.
Draw will only offer this functionality if an appropriate background blending Font Manager is in use, this is required as !Draw appears inside RO350Hook for machines that predate the functionality.
