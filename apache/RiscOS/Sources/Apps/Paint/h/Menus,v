@Add mousewheel zoom/scroll and auto scrolling of selected tools
Detail:
  The mouse wheel can now be used to
  * scroll up/down
  * +shift to scroll left/right
  * +control to zoom in/out
  on an open sprite editing window.
  The sprite editing window will auto scroll when the mouse approaches the border with
  * the move whole sprite "hand" tool
  * the copy block "camera" tool
  * the move block "scissors" tool
Admin:
  Submission for the Paint bounty.

@Fix abort when sorting the sprites by name and one or more sprite viewers
are open, also massively simplified it since the copying around of
main_sprite blocks was pointless - much simpler to just rejoin the linked
list leaving the data in place.
*Tidy up
 Delete awk.*, change to use central 'AwkVers' script.
 Delete h.types.
 Delete h.Paint, it's a duplicate of h.main.
 Delete writepixel, swap to using the one in RISCOS_Lib
 Retire 'h.fixes', switches collapsed, bugfixes proven after 18 years use.
 Cast away some warnings.
 Sprinkled in some consts, moved pointer qualifiers to get syntax colouring
 right.
 Remove local SWI defines, read from <swis.h> now.
 !MkInstall now installs into <Install$Dir>.Apps
*Little UI changes
 Make the colour number in the colour picker be in the right place vertically
 and correct horizontal position of 'T' and 'E' for ECFs.
 In the create new sprite dialogue box the 32k and 16M options are shaded
 when a palette is requested, this avoids the problem of selecting a deep
 colour mode (which trapped the radio icon in a shaded paletted selection).
 The 'Selection' menu is now shaded when there are zero sprites in the
 file
*Sprite filer
 Fix tiled main window fill to work in EX0 modes and not overwrite in EX2
 modes (was using the sprite's mode word not the current mode to deduce eigen
 factors), leading to odd chequer board areas not being redrawn.
 Refactored main_clear_background() to use stronger typing of RISC_OSLib
 rather than _swix where possible.
 A failure to get the Wimp pixel translation table now falls back to solid
 fill
 Double clicking on a sprite in the sprite file window no longer leaves it
 selected, to mimic the filer.
 Set DISPLAY_MARGIN to 0 to counter for the recent increase from 32 to 40
 of main_FILER_TextHeight
 Added 'Sort by size' after 'Sort by name'

@Deleted some junk from CVS.
On creating a new sprite (which is white) an attempt is made to select the
furthest colour from white in the palette.
Corrected icon shading in create dialogue,redid create template.
On closing a file the sprites are freed in reverse order in an attempt to
make it faster (as the blocks are flex'd in the other order) - will speed
up some situations.
When there are 0 sprites in a file the "Save" entry is greyed,this was
causing a internal error nasty looking error box before.
Tweak to allow the debug to be compiled again.
Filesize info box now used OS_ConvertFileSize as the display field
overflowed for files > 1M ish.
File info box made longer than 50 characters,that was a bit stingy.
Local flood fill with transparent mask added.
Reworded some of the messages.
Added "sort by name" to misc menu - sorts the sprites by name oddly enough.
The delete rows/columns now rounds up the grid coordinates,before there
were cases where you could never quite select the edge column/row,for
example a 79*98 sprites zoomed to x8 versus x7.
