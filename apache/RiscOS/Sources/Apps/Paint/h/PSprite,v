4.5
log
@Various bugfixes. Improve sprite info dialog.
Detail:
  - Handling of currently selected foreground & background colour rewritten; colour is now stored as a 'main_colour' struct, in order to allow representation of alpha level, pixel colour/palette index (which must be 4 bytes for things like CMYK) and ECF index (previously encoded as negative colour values). Fixes crashes when editing RISC OS 5 32bpp ARGB sprites. Note that although the alpha level is now stored internally, and tools should mostly respect it, palette/colour picker limitations mean that only 0/255 is available when selecting colours.
  - "Select colour" code rewritten to decode all the new pixel formats correctly; colours_entry() now accepts a sprite mode word instead of a number-of-colours value
  - "Full info" display tweaked to give more information about the mask (now displays no mask, normal mask, alpha mask, alpha channel)
  - Sprite info dialog extended to display lots more information, including OS version compatibility
  - Fix sprite menu to disallow add/remove mask option if the sprite has a RISC OS 5 alpha channel
  - Fix ECF pattern that's used for the background of masked sprites to get black/white colour values from ColourTrans when in >8bpp modes, to ensure correct colours in new RISC OS 5 modes
  - Fix palette window to render ECF patterns correctly - when creating the sprite that shows the ECF pattern in the palette, psprite_setup_ecf() was failing to set its palette due to passing a sprite pointer to ColourTrans but setting the flags as if it was a sprite name
  - Fix sprwindow_redisplay() and sprwindow_invalidate() to refresh the display correctly when in full info mode; was previously assuming only one column of sprites visible
  - Fix sprites with alpha channels to have the mask ECF pattern plotted in the background
  Files changed:
  - Resources/UK/Messages, Resources/UK/Templates,fec, c/Colours, c/Main, c/Menus, c/PSprite, c/SprWindow, c/Tools, h/Colours, h/MenuD, h/PSprite, h/main
Admin:
  Tested on BB-xM
  Amongst others, fixes issue reported on forums with spritefile window not refreshing correctly when in full info display with multiple columns:

@Fix rendering issues in new screen modes. Add basic support for new sprite types.
Detail:
  c/Main, c/PSprite, h/main - Update window background rendering & sprite translation table caching to work properly with new screen modes.
  c/Main, c/Menus, c/PSprite, h/PSprite, h/main - Code to generate description text for sprite colour count now uses new shared function, psprite_get_colours(), which understands the new sprite formats and won't crash horribly if given something unknown.
Admin:
  Tested on BB-xM with new format sprites and new screen modes
  Needs extending to report more info about new format sprites (RGB order, alpha channel, wide mask, etc.) along with relevant editing facilities.
  Part of an implementation of the Extended Framebuffer Format spec:

log
@Fix abort when sorting the sprites by name and one or more sprite viewers
are open, also massively simplified it since the copying around of
main_sprite blocks was pointless - much simpler to just rejoin the linked
list leaving the data in place.
*Tidy up
 Delete awk.*, change to use central 'AwkVers' script.
 Delete h.types.
 Delete h.Paint, it's a duplicate of h.main.
 Delete writepixel, swap to using the one in RISCOS_Lib
 Retire 'h.fixes', switches collapsed, bugfixes proven after 18 years use.
 Cast away some warnings.
 Sprinkled in some consts, moved pointer qualifiers to get syntax colouring
 right.
 Remove local SWI defines, read from <swis.h> now.
 !MkInstall now installs into <Install$Dir>.Apps
*Little UI changes
 Make the colour number in the colour picker be in the right place vertically
 and correct horizontal position of 'T' and 'E' for ECFs.
 In the create new sprite dialogue box the 32k and 16M options are shaded
 when a palette is requested, this avoids the problem of selecting a deep
 colour mode (which trapped the radio icon in a shaded paletted selection).
 The 'Selection' menu is now shaded when there are zero sprites in the
 file
*Sprite filer
 Fix tiled main window fill to work in EX0 modes and not overwrite in EX2
 modes (was using the sprite's mode word not the current mode to deduce eigen
 factors), leading to odd chequer board areas not being redrawn.
 Refactored main_clear_background() to use stronger typing of RISC_OSLib
 rather than _swix where possible.
 A failure to get the Wimp pixel translation table now falls back to solid
 fill
 Double clicking on a sprite in the sprite file window no longer leaves it
 selected, to mimic the filer.
 Set DISPLAY_MARGIN to 0 to counter for the recent increase from 32 to 40
 of main_FILER_TextHeight
 Added 'Sort by size' after 'Sort by name'

log
@  Changes to SpriteFile window to allow selections and
  sprite edit window changed to improve positioning accuracy.
Detail:
  * Wimp_EScroll event added to make wheelmouse work.
  * Tool rubber banding now snaps to pixel centres making location easier.
  * flickering of box stopped in move (hand) tool.
  * Bottom left of sprites used in painting aligned with grid and sprite plotted
    directly under moving version.
  * Text painting now plots under the moving version of the text.
  * copy, move and hand tools cancel dragging with Adjust.
  * SpriteFile window changed to allow selections using Select,Adjust or Drag.
  * Alt-Select/Adjust on name allows renaming of sprite.
  * TAB moves rename icon to next sprite.
  * Shift TAB moves rename icon to previous sprite
  * Ctrl-Return renames sprite and moves the rename icon to the
    next sprite.
 V2 changes
  * Rubber band rectangular boxes with 0 width or height drawn as a
   line so they don't disappear.
  * Parallelogram rubber band where all the points are in line drawn
    as a line so they don't disappear.
