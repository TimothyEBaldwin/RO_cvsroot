@  Changes to SpriteFile window to allow selections and
  sprite edit window changed to improve positioning accuracy.
Detail:
  * Wimp_EScroll event added to make wheelmouse work.
  * Tool rubber banding now snaps to pixel centres making location easier.
  * flickering of box stopped in move (hand) tool.
  * Bottom left of sprites used in painting aligned with grid and sprite plotted
    directly under moving version.
  * Text painting now plots under the moving version of the text.
  * copy, move and hand tools cancel dragging with Adjust.
  * SpriteFile window changed to allow selections using Select,Adjust or Drag.
  * Alt-Select/Adjust on name allows renaming of sprite.
  * TAB moves rename icon to next sprite.
  * Shift TAB moves rename icon to previous sprite
  * Ctrl-Return renames sprite and moves the rename icon to the
    next sprite.
 V2 changes
  * Rubber band rectangular boxes with 0 width or height drawn as a
   line so they don't disappear.
  * Parallelogram rubber band where all the points are in line drawn
    as a line so they don't disappear.

@Deleted some junk from CVS.
On creating a new sprite (which is white) an attempt is made to select the
furthest colour from white in the palette.
Corrected icon shading in create dialogue,redid create template.
On closing a file the sprites are freed in reverse order in an attempt to
make it faster (as the blocks are flex'd in the other order) - will speed
up some situations.
When there are 0 sprites in a file the "Save" entry is greyed,this was
causing a internal error nasty looking error box before.
Tweak to allow the debug to be compiled again.
Filesize info box now used OS_ConvertFileSize as the display field
overflowed for files > 1M ish.
File info box made longer than 50 characters,that was a bit stingy.
Local flood fill with transparent mask added.
Reworded some of the messages.
Added "sort by name" to misc menu - sorts the sprites by name oddly enough.
The delete rows/columns now rounds up the grid coordinates,before there
were cases where you could never quite select the edge column/row,for
example a 79*98 sprites zoomed to x8 versus x7.
