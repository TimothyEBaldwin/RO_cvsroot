4.2
log
@Deleted some junk from CVS.
On creating a new sprite (which is white) an attempt is made to select the
furthest colour from white in the palette.
Corrected icon shading in create dialogue,redid create template.
On closing a file the sprites are freed in reverse order in an attempt to
make it faster (as the blocks are flex'd in the other order) - will speed
up some situations.
When there are 0 sprites in a file the "Save" entry is greyed,this was
causing a internal error nasty looking error box before.
Tweak to allow the debug to be compiled again.
Filesize info box now used OS_ConvertFileSize as the display field
overflowed for files > 1M ish.
File info box made longer than 50 characters,that was a bit stingy.
Local flood fill with transparent mask added.
Reworded some of the messages.
Added "sort by name" to misc menu - sorts the sprites by name oddly enough.
The delete rows/columns now rounds up the grid coordinates,before there
were cases where you could never quite select the edge column/row,for
example a 79*98 sprites zoomed to x8 versus x7.
