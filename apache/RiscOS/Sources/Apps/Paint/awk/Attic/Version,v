4.2
log
@Fix abort when sorting the sprites by name and one or more sprite viewers
are open, also massively simplified it since the copying around of
main_sprite blocks was pointless - much simpler to just rejoin the linked
list leaving the data in place.
*Tidy up
 Delete awk.*, change to use central 'AwkVers' script.
 Delete h.types.
 Delete h.Paint, it's a duplicate of h.main.
 Delete writepixel, swap to using the one in RISCOS_Lib
 Retire 'h.fixes', switches collapsed, bugfixes proven after 18 years use.
 Cast away some warnings.
 Sprinkled in some consts, moved pointer qualifiers to get syntax colouring
 right.
 Remove local SWI defines, read from <swis.h> now.
 !MkInstall now installs into <Install$Dir>.Apps
*Little UI changes
 Make the colour number in the colour picker be in the right place vertically
 and correct horizontal position of 'T' and 'E' for ECFs.
 In the create new sprite dialogue box the 32k and 16M options are shaded
 when a palette is requested, this avoids the problem of selecting a deep
 colour mode (which trapped the radio icon in a shaded paletted selection).
 The 'Selection' menu is now shaded when there are zero sprites in the
 file
*Sprite filer
 Fix tiled main window fill to work in EX0 modes and not overwrite in EX2
 modes (was using the sprite's mode word not the current mode to deduce eigen
 factors), leading to odd chequer board areas not being redrawn.
 Refactored main_clear_background() to use stronger typing of RISC_OSLib
 rather than _swix where possible.
 A failure to get the Wimp pixel translation table now falls back to solid
 fill
 Double clicking on a sprite in the sprite file window no longer leaves it
 selected, to mimic the filer.
 Set DISPLAY_MARGIN to 0 to counter for the recent increase from 32 to 40
 of main_FILER_TextHeight
 Added 'Sort by size' after 'Sort by name'

@Version number now extracted from the VersionNum file and inserted into
messages at build time.
Saving palette files now preserve the attributes if a file of the same name
already existed in the target directory.
New tool sprites (and corresponding changed Templates)
Now strips dependencies when cleaned.
