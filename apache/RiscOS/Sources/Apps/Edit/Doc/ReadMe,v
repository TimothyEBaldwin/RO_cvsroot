Documentation on how to use Edit can be found in Edition 2 of the Archimedes
User Guide.

The following remarks should be noted about this version of Edit and its
documentation.

The TAB key can be used to move the caret along the line to the column
position that matches the start of the next word boundary on the line above,
provided that the 'line above' is not wrapped.

When forming a selection using the SELECT and ADJUST mouse keys, if CTRL is
held down, the caret will not be moved. This makes it easier to copy a block
of text to where the caret already is: hold down CTRL, make the selection,
type C, release CTRL.

ADJUST on the close box of an Edit window will close the window (if the
window is not modified) and open the parent directory viewer. This should be
thought of as similar to ADJUST on the close box of a directory viewer.

The vertical scroll bar indicates the fraction of the file currently visible
as a fraction of the total number of characters, rather than as a fraction of
the number of lines.  This means that the length of the vertical scroll bar
will vary dependent upon the number of characters in the window.

If a desktop closedown sequence (e.g. Exit from the Task manager menu)
occurs when Edit has some modified buffers, Edit sometimes erroneously
terminates the desktop closedown sequence. It is of course normal practice
to save your work before trying to exit the desktop.

The following features are added since Edit 1.00, and not mentioned in the
Archimedes User Guide or A3000 User Guide.

Column tab mode: in this mode the tab key will insert spaces to align the
cursor to a multiple of 8 columns vertically. The mode is toggled by a menu
entry on the Misc menu, or by sh-f3.

Overwrite mode: in this mode characters typed will overwrite existing
characters in the file, rather than being inserted: this is useful for
editing fixed-format forms etc. The mode is toggled by a menu entry on the
Misc menu, or by sh-f1.

Wordwrap mode: in this mode characters typed (and also simple deletion
characters) will cause continuous reformatting of the text following the
cursor, as if format-text (ctl-f6) were being selected after every
keystroke. The mode is toggled by a menu entry on the Misc menu, or
by ctl-f5.

All three modes are displayed on the title bar of the window to which they
apply.

The default settings of newly created windows can be set in Edit$Options.
  O - set overwrite mode
  D - set worDwrap mode
  T - set column Tab mode
Example:
  *Set Edit$Options l-3 t h12 w8 nCorpus.Medium

It's also possible to set the size of the undo buffer attatched to a window
in this way, by using
  U<number> - set size of Undo buffer, in bytes.
The default value is 5000 bytes per window (less is taken if there is no
space available).

If you drag a file into an Edit window (as though inserting the file) but
keep the shift key held down while doing this, then the full path-name of
the file (rather than the file itself) is inserted. This can be very useful
when constructing command scripts.

The following textual messages are included in !Edit's image. You can
replace them by adding a line with a suitable tag at the front to the
Messages resource file.
