@Fix ROM resources phase to not install !Sprites22
When in ROM there's no need to stuff the sprites into ResourceFS since they're in the Wimp pool. Moreover, only !Sprites22 was being installed, so if booting into a low res mode !Edit wouldn't start because !Sprites was not found.
* Ammended Makefile to not do sprites during resources
* Ammended Makefile to do both resolution sprites for the disc install
* Used StdTools and ModuleLibs shared makefiles
* Resolved some of the easy warnings
* Changed to use '_Version' as the info box token, so allowing use of the centralised AwkVers script
* Added ROM !Boot file (as !Draw has) which is a cutdown version of the disc one
Tested briefly, still loads files and opens task windows OK.

@Info box date changed to be dd-mmm-yy
Date string in its module guise is now fetched from the VersionASM file
rather than the 7 year out of date Messages file.
Found dialogue no longer has a close icon,this caused it to gain an
iconise icon which in turn meant it could be iconised leaving a dead
window on the screen that noone owned.
Misc tweaks to account for the ever moving memory map.

@  Fixed a possible syntax error in awk script.
Detail:
  Also added extra checking to make sure that only macro definitions are
    parsed when looking for the application date string.
Admin:
  Still works for me - hopefully works on build machine too.
