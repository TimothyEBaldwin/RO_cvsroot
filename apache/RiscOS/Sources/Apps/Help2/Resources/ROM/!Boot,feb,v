log
@Given hypenated date in info box.
Makefile changed so it can be put in ROM (ages ago!)
ROM versions of boot and run files changed to use !Help icon in Wimp sprites
file rather than trying to iconsprites its own copy (removed).
Mode changes bin then regrab the font handle in case eigen values changed.
