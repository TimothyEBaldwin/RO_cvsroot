@Another intermediate check-in, resources may not be up to date; items
most likely to be buildable are PhoenixJ and BrowseD. Done because I'm
about to make some rather dodgy changes to code otherwise unchanged
since the Customer browser and I may well have to back them out...

In Handlers.c now set the HFlags_HasBeenVisited bit of a token at the point
it is first clicked on. Means the link returns to a "visited" colour after
the highlight flash immediately. This will persist for as long as the browser
window is kept open on that page, though if the URL doesn't end up making it
into the history for whatever reason it would "unhighlight" on reload; fair
enough, really. The highlight is window-local, so there are no redraw worries
for other open windows with links to the same URL (though other same-URL
links on the same page aren't updated either).

All forms submissions force a reload (principally for eudoramail.com, but
many other sites have similar requirements).

!MkClean and !MkClnAll didn't correctly call the utility to strip Makefile
dependencies. Fixed.

On fetch closedown, fetchpage_preprocess_token could be called on a token
which had already been run through the preprocessor. Now checks the flags
word before proceeding.

Image RAM cache and garbage collection system implemented - see new Choices
file entries CollectAfter, FreeRAMLimit and UnusedImageLimit to get an
overview. This contains groundwork for JavaScript image array support.

More JavaScript support improvements. Any one window object will know its
parent, top, this, etc.; frames array working except for a frameset created
via. multiple documents; opener for something created with window.open is
currently not set and don't know why (property is being created, pointer to
valid object is held, but JS engine returns 'null'. Ho hum) - JSChain won't
work yet, then.

log
@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.

1.1
log
@Added various TaskObey files to make different browser variants (the Makefile
has been updated to support this). At present, TARGET must be set for the
Make file to work (some oddity in AMU causing problems here). Added
Multiuser.h to cope with a non-SINGLE_USER build for Customer.
