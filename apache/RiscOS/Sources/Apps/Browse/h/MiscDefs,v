64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.

@Removed 'The Onion' link from some Hotlist files. Time showed that the
site wasn't entirely Family Friendly (TM)... Removed Shift Control (it's
gone offline now), and corrected the Telegraph URL from ...the-telegraph...
to just ...telegraph...

StrongHelp manual generator now tries to work out the number of lines in
the table on the root page more intelligently.

Plug-in support extended to handle Shockwave. Quite a lot of underlying
work for this, including a pseudo cache system for temporary files.

Bug in redraw routines: they plotted background images within table
cells, when nothing should have been drawn. Oops. When background images
in cells are properly supported, this can get sorted out.

Tweaked vertical plot position of HRs (up to 4 OS units too high before due
to rounding).

Various Res file bits and pieces, Ursula build taken up to v1.26 beta
for release on the Browser site. *Note* not all resources are up to date!
This will be done after AW97.

1.7

@Big steps forward in vertical white space handling as a result of
improvements in HTMLLib in this area ( -> all versions now 1.22 beta-2).
As a result, the 'last_space' field in browser_data struct has been
removed. Note that this relies quite heavily on setting of the PCDATA
bit in the 'style' field of an HStream and the automatic collapsing
of (for example) multiple P tags inside HTMLLib.

Trace.c improved to recognise various bits in the 'style' field of an
HStream structure.

Phoenix defaults altered to a more 'standard' set of choices; Trinity
as the serif font, with a slightly larger default font size. This is
because there's a good chance it might get released to a wider audience
than Acorn internal (though the animation and icon bar sprites will
have to change before then...).

MiscDefs updated for new SWI numbers in HTTP module; !Run[D] files thus
updated to require HTTP 0.42 or later. At this point, all earlier
modules are not backwards compatible in terms of direct calls to the
HTTP module, though this only affects cookies_process_cookie at present.
At the same time, checks for System$Path, InetDBase$Path, and setting
of Inet$MimeMappings if not already defined have been added to the Run
files along with RMEnsures of Resolver and MimeMap.

Object and PlugIn c/h pairs created to handle OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET,
and the RISC OS Plug-In interface respectively. Not part of the build
process yet. Addition of 'odata' field in browser_data struct and
definition of chunk CK_OBJB for memory_set_chunk_size() are in support
of this.

@Support for ANT URL broadcast message added.

Image deletion routines rewritten; nasty animated GIF bug now gone
(it kept trying to update the cross-referenced image in the browser that
no longer existed, and I've no idea how animated GIFs ever managed to *not*
blow up if a cross referencing browser was shut down; and I've tested
this...). There are now as many image structures as there are total images
in the visible browsers, and no more; cross referenced images in the
to-be-deleted browser have their ownership moved to the cross
referencer before the cross referencee is wiped, with any required fetches
being transferred with them.

Reformatter sped up a bit by getting rid of strlen on the main text field
of tokens in all places bar one, where it is called extremely rarely. This
means direct app-to-app transfer of, say, a 359K text file to the browser
won't run like a drain as it tries to do strlen on a 359K string over and
over again! Most of the time the performance benefits won't really be
noticable, but on the above text file, formatting time went down from
290 seconds before the change to just under 7 seconds, a 41 fold speed
increase or thereabouts (SA110 228MHz).

MakeFile changed to force function name compilation on for debug builds
(-fn in the DD...FLAGS); useful for certain functions such as
register_null_handler, which can now output the name of the function
being registered.

...Which helped show up some nasties in the animation handler and animation
drift handler registration/deregistration process, which have been fixed
(callers of fetchpage_release_nulls were unaware that the drift handler
could be installed, and fragments of old code checking choices.anim_drift
had a value other than 1 or 0 were still hanging around - bit tricky for
a single bit item).

Added support for VALIGN in table cells. Spotted a bug or two in the
'what token is the pointer over' routines as a result, and fixed them - the
worst was in browser_line_at_y, which checked the y coordinate was below
the given one [the mouse], but didn't check the line height to see if the
given y coordinate was *within* the line, rather than just above it. Never
used to matter pre-tables, but a definite concern once multiple line
arrays can exist on one page.

1.4
log
@As warned in the last log, pretty much all event codes and component IDs
have now changed along with many of the names, to provide a consistent
name and numberspace for events and components. This also minimises
number clashes (e.g. as was, the Save File origin when opened from a
Hotlist menu with an already-used component ID). To get full details on
this, please carefully read through TBEvents.h.

Res files, Sprites files and Messages files have been updated again both
due to the above, and routine additions (e.g. message support for a few
Hotlist bits and pieces). !Run[D] files updated for FTP 0.11 and
HTTP 0.36.

In the Makefile, the Customer objects list was missing Save - must have
moved something when I should've copied it, when adding in SaveFile or
SaveObject in all probability. Now fixed. Couple of other bits and bobs
fixed in the build environment (e.g. stuff saying !Argo instead of
!Customer). Oh, and I've altered the MakeFile copy options again to the
best compromise I can come up with. Newer is turned on for everything
except !Run[D] and !RunImage, since both of those change between debug
builds - otherwise if you'd built debug and non-debug versions, it was
not possible to switch between them - one version would have the newer
timestamp and thus never get overwritten.

The default hotlist has had a few items added - that'll be about the end
of it, I think; there's more than enough stuff in there now.

Saving of the hotlist from the document menu and of URI files,
directories and selections from the hotlist menu tree is now implemented
- this new save system rocks... Oh, and you can save all images and
backgrounds as sprites.

Saving of items with Shift+Click to other applications directly now
works, and is robust. Unique Scrap filenames are used, with data load
bounces (e.g. if some pra - er, person quits the app they're sending
to) working correctly - that is, give an error, keep the file, rename
it to something safe, and open the directory it lies in. As opposed
to normal app-to-app bounces, where the scrap file is deleted (see
PRM 3-254). This means you can now look at README files in FTP
sites, say, without using a disc intermediate. Or you can send pictures
straight to ChangeFSI, fetch HTML links into editors, and so-on, and
so-on - it's all very funky. Known problems include the ambiguous
'invalid component ID' instead of 'file open' for *normal* (straight to
disc) shift+click saves, and I think I'll introduce a unique name
guarantee of some sort to stop 'file open' in the first place. Odd
that the really tricky part (app-to-app) should be least likely to
suffer from this!
