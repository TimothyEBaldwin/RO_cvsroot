@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

Version 2.09. Tagged as 'Browse-2_09'

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Long overdue check-in of intermediate browser build, from continued "out
of hours" work. Forgot to add a few files last time too.

List dialogue box handler complete, and exclusion lists implemented
within the main browser code. Full documentation in Choices file.
Save routine knows all about it but is now getting very slow - must
come up with a better scheme; for now, it puts the hourglass on...

StripExtensions option controls auto stripping of filename extensions.

More sensible ancestor / frame selection for keyboard shortcut items
and the save dialogues - having selected a frame won't lock you into
it for F3 and related shortcuts now (input focus in URL writable ->
get ancestor details, input focus in frame -> get frame details). F4
works in frames. F5 now generally present for 'view source' with a
corresponding menu entry in the File menu.

Odd thing in later Res files; there's no action set for Adjust clicks
on the main ToolAction items in the button bar. Very odd. Nothing
appears to be set in v2.07 either, yet adjust-click works. Even
stranger. Anyway, added in the relevant event details (same as for
Select click in all cases) and this fixes the problem.

Background colours in the TABLE tag ignored the "don't print any
backgrounds" Print Style setting. Fixed. Meanwhile, the "black
text with no backgrounds" option wasn't getting this right either;
fixed this also.

Event logging implemented; HTTP errors and script output via.
window.print extension. No internal error output yet.

Faith:Never behaviour extended. If ever a server sends something with
no content type or an unhandleable type, the browser will try and get a
filetype from the URL. If it gets text or HTML, it'll render the file.
Else it'll save it. Hacks around IIS 4's lack of a content type field
in the Marketeye login stuff, and similar other slightly broken sites.

@fetch_get_raw_data will notice if up->fetching is zero and return a
'finished' status rather than trying to continue reading data for the
fetch. Fetches should never fall through that far but at least it
will cope if they do.

3D table borders are now supported. 2D borders are used if the
inter-cell spacing is too small to fit the borders in (display resolution
dependent) - the external table border is 2D if the internal borders are,
else 3D. For cellspacing of 0, internal table borders must plot over the
outer edge of pixels inside the cell; for all greater spacings, the
borders take up all or part of the gap between them. The external border
will always fit around the outside of the cells, including the
cellspacing value in the gap between the outer cells and the border.

Anti-alias colour for placeholder ALT text was incorrect. Fixed.

I'd changed 'point' to 'points' in some of the Font Choices dialogues;
now changed back to 'point'.

The routine to find out how large an otherwise unsized object or image
placeholder based on its ALT text has been centralised in Reformat.c,
so that the image and object routines can both access it without
code duplication (this means non-image objects will now have the correct
size if they contain ALT text, rather than assuming a standard default
size as before). ALT text in images that were also objects was never
plotted either, though the placeholder size would have been correct.
This has been fixed.

@This version is being checked in because the Hotlist manager in the test
build provokes a Wimp bug. All the variant resource files are out of sync
and there are several outstanding bugs in the main code, so I'd personally
avoid this build like the plague unless you're mad enough to want to
examine the Wimp problem ;-)
