64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Intermediate check-in; building a browser from this gives you something
between 2.07 and 2.08. Only the Phoenix JavaScript resources are fully
up to date.

I *think* these are the changes since the last check-in:

When saved as a Draw file, horizontal rules were plotted one page width
too far to the right (wonder when that started happening?!). Fixed. In
addition, DrawFiles now accepted as OBJECTs - they weren't in the
recognised filetype list before. Doh.

Table size calculator tables_count_table would overestimate the number
of cells where ROWSPAN was present and there were other rows below the
one spanned. Fixed. In certain odd cases (e.g. optimised image exports
as HTML tables (!!) from the Gimp) this can save vast amounts of RAM.

Fixed problem where printing stops in the middle of a document. Redraw
engine pagination code was written in the days where lines couldn't
have gaps between them; they can now. If a gap fell at the bottom of
a page the engine would look down, see no line straddling or touching
the page edge, and assume there was nothing more. This case is now
correctly handled.

Made sure desktop and testbed Browse Res files had up-to-date Encoding
menus (v2.07 Phoenix has different menus from v2.07 Browse by oversight).

URL auto-completion piggy-backed onto manual completion code; any string
without '.', '/' or ':' in it gets run through completion to see if a
more meaningful item can be produced - "www" special cased out though.

New List dialogue box handler, used for proxy exclusions etc.
(incomplete), complete with appropriate Res file objects.
