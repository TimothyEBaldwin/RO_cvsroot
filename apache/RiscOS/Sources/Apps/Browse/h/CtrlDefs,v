64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

1.1
log
@Now working on source merged with Kevin Bracey's internationalisation
support. UNIFONT is undefined in the Make File for now. All Res and
Choices files updated appropriately.

Having sorted out the old Choices and Messages to form Choices, Controls
and Messages, this build has had the same cleaning up done internally.
This includes greater consistency in naming schemes and the removal of
the inconsitent choices items - e.g. Choices file entries saying 'delay
images' and 'plain backgrounds' where internally all the flags say 'show
images' and 'show backgrounds'. ChoiceDefs.h and CtrlDefs.h added to
clarify the meaning of some fields, though usage of these is not 100%
in the source (there are cases where parameters are passed through to
functions as ints, and those functions still check these against hard
coded values rather than the #define stuff).

Fetcher status return bits (connected, sent request, etc.) now reflected
in status bar. Progress during fetchs to files are reported by %, where
the size of the object is known. Exceeding 100% drops back to a byte
counter, in case the estimated size was wrong. The progress counter
may be updated after specific delays, rather than 'as often as possible',
to reduce flicker (as requested by D.Brown some time ago).

I've done a small rewrite of the fetch prioritisation scheme in FetchPage.c;
how well this performs in general use across different processor speeds
remains to be tested, but certainly it has some advantages. For each small
fetch window before the rewrite, a 4cs tight loop was entered - this gave a
noticable and substantial drain to the Desktop performance if more than one
was opened. Now, several can be up at once with little hit. The actual file
fetch is on half the priority it was before, with all others taken back
just a bit - e.g. from 20cs per poll to 15cs per poll for flat out
reformatting. You don't seem to lose much time on the format in practice,
and the Desktop feels quite a bit lighter at the same time. There's the
potential for smoother frameset loading in this scheme, too.

When Shift+Clicking on a link meant you still fetched inside the main
browser window, several fetches could occur in a frameset - one per frame.
However, now that you can only do this by clicking on a link that leads to
non-displayable data - or by turning off the small fetch windows by
setting UseSmall to 'no' in Choices - a bug where fetchpage_preprocessed
would stop such fetches as new ones were started was revealed.
The API to frames_abort_fetching has now been extended to include a
'stop file spooling too' flag, allowing a fix to be made by having
fetchpage_preprocess's calls not set this (and it doesn't check the
savelink flag is unset before proceeding, since frames_abort_fetching
does that implicitly now).

Had left the RAM transfer buffer at 16 bytes (from testing) accidentally...
Oops. Upped it to 4K. In addition, when loading data by RAM transfer,
the browser didn't notice if a RAMFetch bounced during the transfer. It
would be treated as a 'first' RAMFetch bounce, basically, and try to go to
file transfer - oops. Fixed.
