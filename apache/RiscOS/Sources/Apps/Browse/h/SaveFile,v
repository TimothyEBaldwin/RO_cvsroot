@  PDF export, some major redraw structural changes, updated resources,
  new build system, extensive Makefile modifications, const/restrict
  additions, various bug fixes.
Detail:
  PDF export facility. SEE Docs.User FOR DETAILS (important!). Includes
  UI for headers/footers in Choices and option switch in Print dialogue
  box. Minor bug fixes include printing bullet points and, at long last,
  the "print dialogue box contents are not set up" problem. Redraw engine
  now based entirely on function pointers. Draw export routine replaces
  screen output functions with Draw output functions; PDF does similar.
  Coordinate scaling system in Scale.c/h to help. Makefile changes: Now
  supports a more consistent set of build variants and has minimal
  duplication of object and library lists. New build system: !Mk...
  script files removed, FrontEnd tool !MkBrowse replaces it. See !ReadMe
  (replacing old ReadMe) in root for details. Requires FrontEnd 1.29,
  HTMLLib 0.02 and ImageLib 0.04 (by CVS VersionNum). Updated resources:
  Some attempt to bring all variants to a working level, but not much
  testing. Only the Phoenix JavaScript capable builds (Unicode or normal)
  are fully up to date, though, including PDF UI additions. Many other
  minor tweaks, and extensive use of const and restrict qualifiers
  propagated through source code in response to their use in the new
  redraw system.
Admin:
  Draw and PDF export tested quite heavily. Appears to work well. Text
  file 'Docs.User' describes limitations. Note required new module and
  library versions listed above. Note that only JavaScript capable
  Phoenix resources are updated and only Phoenix was heavily tested.

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Long overdue check-in of intermediate browser build, from continued "out
of hours" work. Forgot to add a few files last time too.

List dialogue box handler complete, and exclusion lists implemented
within the main browser code. Full documentation in Choices file.
Save routine knows all about it but is now getting very slow - must
come up with a better scheme; for now, it puts the hourglass on...

StripExtensions option controls auto stripping of filename extensions.

More sensible ancestor / frame selection for keyboard shortcut items
and the save dialogues - having selected a frame won't lock you into
it for F3 and related shortcuts now (input focus in URL writable ->
get ancestor details, input focus in frame -> get frame details). F4
works in frames. F5 now generally present for 'view source' with a
corresponding menu entry in the File menu.

Odd thing in later Res files; there's no action set for Adjust clicks
on the main ToolAction items in the button bar. Very odd. Nothing
appears to be set in v2.07 either, yet adjust-click works. Even
stranger. Anyway, added in the relevant event details (same as for
Select click in all cases) and this fixes the problem.

Background colours in the TABLE tag ignored the "don't print any
backgrounds" Print Style setting. Fixed. Meanwhile, the "black
text with no backgrounds" option wasn't getting this right either;
fixed this also.

Event logging implemented; HTTP errors and script output via.
window.print extension. No internal error output yet.

Faith:Never behaviour extended. If ever a server sends something with
no content type or an unhandleable type, the browser will try and get a
filetype from the URL. If it gets text or HTML, it'll render the file.
Else it'll save it. Hacks around IIS 4's lack of a content type field
in the Marketeye login stuff, and similar other slightly broken sites.

@Everyone else seems to be checking lots of stuff in lately, so I've
decided to join in. This is an intermediate check-in and so not all
resources etc. will be up to date. You should be able to make Phoenix
and a debug build out of it. As a reminder, to make a JavaScript build:

 * Build JSLib and NSPRLib. Recommend you leave -DUSEMEMLIB in there (as
   used by default) so you can watch it leak into a dynamic area... :-)
   If you do this, you'll need to build MemLib too, of course. If you
   do NOT use MemLib, *undefine JS_USING_MEMLIB in Main.c*!
 * Run !MkClean. This now strips dynamic dependencies from the MakeFile
   automatically, to save you having to do it yourself.
 * Run one of the TaskObey files with the "J" suffix, e.g. !DeskBrwsJ -
   this uses the same .o directory for object files and exports to the
   same position in the Targets directory as the non-JavaScript build,
   but it does produce a unique binary in 'abs' and symbols table in
   'syms'.
 * Sourcing an appropriate !Run (with increased WimpSlot value), !Boot
   and About resource is done automatically.
 * Some, but not all of the !xxxD (debug) TaskObey files will make
   JavaScript versions in passing - check the JSUFFIX value on the Make
   command line parameters in the file.

This'll only work on RISC OS 3.1 due to the use of MemLib.

Here's the change list:

Included MNG icons in sprites files; added Sprites23 for some builds.
Added in ANT URL file icon (b28) derived from URI file icon, because
the Save dialogue can need it.

No, you do *not* need to define the same keyboard shortcuts in each
frame since the ancestor keeps the input focus and we've basically
dropped non-nested Wimp support. Maintaining no less than 4 lists of
identical shortcuts was a pain. Some Res files now only have the
lists in the main browser window and button bar objects (these two
are both required still).

Ursula build Markers button arrangement changed from 1x3 horizontal to
2x2 tilted, as in Phoenix, by popular demand.

Couple of hotlist bugs fixed; dragging an item and deleteing it with
Ctrl+X didn't terminate the drag, and deleteting an item underneath a
menu opened for it didn't close the menu.

'SendReferer' option added to all Choices files, all set to 'always'.
Put just beneath 'Clone' as it refers to header items, though really,
both Clone and SendReferer should probably be in the "Fetch controls"
section rather than "Multiuser environments and proxying"! Front-end
control of this is available.

In image_export_original, save_save_source, save_transfer_source and
save_save_object, flex_set_budge(0) was called to lock the heap but the
return value wasn't stored. flex_set_budge(1) was then used to unlock
the heap. All calls now remember and restore the old value, which is
both safer in case one calls another and allows the flex_set_budge
call in Main.c to have an application-wide meaning, as intended.

Some restructuring to the data load and RAM transfer sections of
Protocols.c; remote hotlist builds wouldn't allow files to be loaded
to browser windows before, and can now drop URL, URI or text files to
the Open URL dialogue.

New option "MinimumFontSize", lets the 'size' attribute of the 'font'
element be overridden. Default value is 1, to allow the full range of
values for the attribute. Setting to 7, for example, would give font
size 7 text at all times. Another new option, "ToggleOnXOnly", to
make Toggle Size only extend the window vertically (with Ctrl then
being used to toggle to genuine full size, rather than vice versa).
All Choices files updated to hold both of these options; only the
first has front-end control available (see debug build Res file).

JavaScript Document object exists; frames array etc. working. Can now
just about use "http://www.acorn.com/~ahodgkin/jschain/" but it does
abort after a bit - problems with frames again, I suspect. Is is pretty
slow, too. Can now press Escape to terminate a script.

Main.c erroneously referred to Controls file entry "StopWebServe" as
"StopWebProxy". Fixed.

Keyboard shortcuts to raise SaveFile are now possible in a general sense;
the code before was in the ToBeShown handler and just checked for a parent
component of -1. It then assumed "save frame HTML source". Now there's the
savefile_raise_from_shortcut function, which together with the seven new
event codes in SaveFile.h allows saving of HTML source and frame location,
export of links, images, backgrounds and the page as text or draw, to all
be invoked by keyboard shortcuts. Some Res files have some of these defined.

In reformat_check_height, the first check to see if setpara should be set
references a field in tpLast without checking if it is NULL. Whilst the
'line > 0' check should mean that tpLast wasn't NULL anyway, a direct
call to the function from outside of the reformatter might have tripped
up on this - the check for tpLast != NULL is now made.

Adjust-click on close icon in window showing file: URL attempts to open
the parent Filer window.

Reformatter used to try and find a selectable token if keyboard control
was enabled in a really stupid place - could make reformatting become
very slow if no selectables were present, especially if the page had a
few tables on it. Preprocessor now does this (since it goes through all
of the tokens anyway), the reformatter just doing a last check to ensure
no frames have obscured the selectable and if so, it tries to move it.
Done in the reformatter as generating a line array implies the data really
is visible.

Ctrl+Tab URL completion now builds a full list of matches from the hotlist
and history and can cycle through them (Ctrl+Shift+Tab stepping backwards).

Will give a real error rather than just "Data Abort" if it goes wrong
now. Someone somewhere is setting bit 30 of the error which confused
the replacement signal handler. Flag bits are now masked off (as they
should've been to start with).

@Check for WindowManager 3.97 and ensure Unicode$Path is set in all
!Run[D] files, don't set the Alias$@@PrintType_FF4 variable, and updated
Customer build ROM obey file variants. Various other changes to
the Run files for new module versions, updated paths to support
new positions of choices, hotlist and histories (see later), etc.

!Sprites[22] files hold small !app icons for some variants, and
an ic_browse sprite. Some variants now have a Sprites and Sprites22
file instead of just Sprites, with the former containing various
mode 12 or 15 specific sprites.

Text files dragged to the URL writable are treated as ANT URL files. This
relies on URLBarWrit (Toolbars.h) being a unique ID, which it should be,
but beware of the Hotlist and Choices numberspaces...

INPUT TYPE=BUTTON supported. Form items without a FORM tag are now shown
(as MSIE 4, but not NN 4).

'*', '-', '@@', '_' and '.' are not escaped when submitting forms now. The
Web interface to the IMDb now works.

INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN items will not affect the line height anymore - so
http://www.hotmail.com/ now has correctly aligned writable icons, for
example. Similarly, TAG_FORM and TAG_FORM_END items could push up
line height and don't anymore.

HRs with a specified pixel width will now influence the size of a table
cell (they didn't before).

BRs now checked by tagno field when the browser needs to know something
was an actual BR tag rather than just a line break signal, and by the
style bit entry when only the indication of a line break is required.

Table widths of 0 or 0% are ignored.

Trace.c updated to report height and background fields in a table_stream.

fm_putsl() writes a terminator into the string; the Forms.c routines were
calling this for displaying INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD fields using the FE_PassCode
literal string (a line of stars). This write into a read only data area
would make the debugger fault the access. A local char array is now used
instead, to get round this (note the use of var[]=literal rather than
var[sizeof(literal)]; strcpy(var, literal) due to some weird compiler bug
that copies the wrong thing into 'var' under some (undefined...)
circumstances).

Text areas don't scroll back to the top line when clicked in anymore;
single line writables don't scroll back to the left either. When
reentering a text area from 'above', the caret appears at the top line
rather than 'somewhere further down'...

ARROWS_MOVE_OUT compile time option at the top of Forms.c defines whether
you must press Tab/Shift+Tab to move between writable fields in forms or
if up/down will drop out of them, though if keyboard control is on this
is enforced (or you get trapped inside the form!).

urlutils_filetype_from_url now uses MimeMap module.

If fetcher is told a page is text, it'll check for a filename extension and
may choose to use this instead (e.g. it may find it's HTML instead). This
is to try and get around duff servers... (e.g. http://www.batalarms.co.uk/).

Save dialogues shouldn't flicker when options that don't change the
filetype are selected (before, the draggable sprite was always reset for
each selection). Noticed the erroneous setting of a static variable in
SaveFile.c by a call to this by SaveObject.c, and so added a flag to
savefile_set_filetype to deal with this - would have been possible to get
the wrong filetype sent to applications or at best the wrong filetype
sprite in the dialogue without that.

The caret shouldn't jump out of a form back to the URL writable if the page
reformats now.

Table background colours now supported (as in the colour you see in the
border space if the cellspacing is large enough; this is as in MSIE, not
as in Navigator). Drawfile output routines updated accordingly.

Corrected erroneous use of wimpt_dx() / wimpt_dy() in a couple of places
in Images.c, which meant that (say) 1x1 images didn't work correctly in
medium resolution display modes.

Now have support for save as text (component ID and event 0x12) and save
as Draw (component ID and event 0x13) buttons. Dubious conditions for
greying and ungreying the print, save source and view source buttons and
menu options sorted out as part of implementing the same for the two new
buttons; added greying out of their associated menu items in passing.

Turned kerning on in draw file objects (does mean a rather heinous
increase in file size, but this is the only way to ensure the draw file
matches the visible page).

Comments before functions in SaveDraw.c are now complete and up to date.

Image and visit histories now generate a crude hash number to speed up
searching for items. It does give a speed increase, though it's a
disappointingly small one.

Issue of left/right margins and cellpaddings sorted out. Now have
redraw_left/right_margin for finding out the basic gap you must leave.
redraw_left/right_gap then gives any extra indentation for LI, BLOCKQUOTE
or whatever. The last two can be subtracted from the display width to
get an available page width for any section of text. Note that
redraw_left_gap replaces redraw_margin. The redraw_start_x function
uses the above to work out where a line's left hand edge should be,
taking account of left/right/centre alignment. HRs have been fixed now
(they were quite broken in v1.30, I think) based on this new model and
the behaviour of MSIE/NN 4.

Fixed width of cells with no contents - cell padding values wouldn't
have worked properly as the reformatter returns 0 rather than the left
hand margin size if given no stream.

Removed FM_Absolute flags for Font_Paint (spotted by DBrown) - sets bit
2, which is reserved...?

IMG width and height in % terms now works correctly; a % of available
width (after margins and indents) or height on the main page or for
a table cell, if the image lies in one. Because of the chicken-and-egg
problem with the latter, the cell must specify a width and/or height
for things to work properly. If this is not done, you'll usually end
up with a 1:1 scaled image (as in Navigator 4, rather than ending up
with no image or even no cell (!), as in MSIE 4).

HEIGHT attribute on a TABLE tag is supported, but only in a crude
fashion; the extra height (if there is any) is distributed over the
rows in a linear fashion. This is probably all you have to do in
practice, but I haven't checked. To maintain a notion of min/max
height as well as width would of course require a great deal more
work...

If using client pull to reload a page with a fragment ('...#name')
specified, then the reload wouldn't work on the same page; it'd just
jump to the fragment position. This won't happen if b->reloading is
set now (so works in conjunction with client pull on the same page
forcing a non-cached fetch). Similarly, if POSTing to such a URL,
a fetch will proceed (both these fixes done originally for
http://jupiter.beseen.com/chat/rooms/g/1678/).

browser_inherit split to browser_inherit and browser_inherit_post_data;
the code for the latter didn't clear any post_data in the child before
copying from the parent either, and could cause flex errors (now fixed).

Res file for Ursula ('Desktop' Browse) build tweaked - bits in the
font choices dialogue renamed, and button bar rearranged to hold the
new Save As Draw button. Other builds have had Save As Draw and
Save As Text buttons added, or not, depending upon availability of
suitable sprites, required UI simplicity, etc.

Now have:

  Browse$ChoicesFile
  Browse$ControlsFile
  Browse$ChoicesSave
  Browse$ControlsSave

(the last two are new) for loading and saving of the Choices or Controls
files. If unset, <App$Dir>.Choices or <App$Dir>.Controls will be set.
E.g., you could set Browse$ChoicesFile to be:

  <App$Dir>.Choices,Choices:WWW.(app).Choices

for loading and

  <Choices$Write>.WWW.(app).Choices

for saving. (The browser never saves Controls at the moment, so the
relevant variable above isn't effectively implemented, but could be
in future). Similarly, to support asymetric loading/saving of the Hotlist,
there are HotlistSave, HistorySave and ImageHistorySave entries in Choices
to complement HotlistPath, HistoryPath and ImageHistoryPath (which are used
for loading). save_save_choices will create directories as needed to obtain
the given path (and has also been fixed in various areas that hadn't been
tested out until now; e.g. zero termination of the AppName$ChoicesFile
variable expansion...). !Run[D] files updated appropriately.

Table widthing code rewritten. Slower, but a lot better on the whole.
Still has some problems - still needs a final 'make sure nothing is
below minimum width' scan, which it should be possible to do without.
No time to fix this at present!

The reformatter will now 'glue together' an LI token followed by any
non-LI token; so a bullet point followed by an item should not be able to
have a line break inserted after the bullet because of very tight width
constraints (it could before - yuk...).

'about:' brings up a page about the browser and any Plug-Ins, as with
Navigator (for example).

URI files support titles, as per spec. version 8. Saving a current
location to the Hotlist will thus give a sensible title now (unless
you're in a frame, so there's no title to get...). Of course, v1.00
files without a title still work.

Note that NOBR is *not* supported in this build and this combined with
the new table widther may cause problems on some sites (e.g. Microsoft's
home page!).

@Not all resources are up to date in this check-in, and documentation
both within source and stuff in 'Docs' is out of date or missing - I
was very pushed for time on this one... Hopefully will do another
'tidy up' check-in before close on Friday; until then, beware of
anything other than the Ursula (Desktop browser) build. Anyway...

Export As Draw done. As part of this, FONT SIZE and SUP / SUB adjustment
of font size is done in fm_token_font_info rather than fm_find_token_font.

Bullets and switches are plotted as indirected sprite items, rather than
indirected text + sprite items - this relied on being in a redraw loop to
pick the sprites up from the local pool (failed during printing).

URI files now have a LF line ending rather than CR... '*' recognised
as an empty field when loading via. RAM transfer now (only worked for
loading from disc before).

Gave placeholder bounding boxes 4 OS units more minimum extra gap
vertically and reduced horizontal addition to this value * 1.5, rather
than * 2 (see reformat_get_placeholder_size).

Background image tiling starts at ymax - h + 4, rather than ymax, so
there isn't the bottom line of pixels from the top tile always present
at the top of the window. The '+4' is for caution's sake.

Can now save a frame's HTML source, that of its parent or its ancestor,
and the same for the URI pointing to those documents - see Menus.h for
the relevant component IDs that should lead to the SaveFile dialogue.

Have hopefully fixed timeout = 0 values (i.e. 'forever') on things
like LinkTo; before, image fetches could override the state (so you'd
only ever see brief flickers of a given URL as the pointer went over
a link).

Save File dialogue will remember the state of option or radio buttons
for a given parent component origin and restore that state when the
dialogue is next opened from the same place (stops turning on saving
as a URL file also turning on 'save background images' for Draw file
export, etc.).

Use of a META tag to reload the *same* page now sets the 'reloading'
flag in the browser so that it doesn't go through a proxy - otherwise
pages which are meant to update periodically through client pull
don't work, as they keep coming out of the cache.

Can now handle images specifying just a width or height in the HTML
(other dimension is scaled accordingly, but note that the placeholder
size must still be 'dumb' until the image data comes in). An image
will now override an image history size entry for the same entry
with a different size.

@There are a few known significant problems with this code but it's being
checked in so the Choices can be worked on. Note that Res files etc. are
not up to date across all builds. Progress is as follows...

Bug report prompted me to do this - now ignore <p> tags straight after
<li> tags, so '<ul><li><p>Some text' works as the author (or automatic
generator, more commonly) intended.

A <p> tag before a table will be acted upon now (it was ignored before).
Something like <li><p><table...> will give a line break and paragraph
space after the <li> despite the changes mentioned above, as in other browsers.
Both browsers differ from Navigator, where the table appears alongside
the <li> tag.

Multiple BR tags work as in MSIE / Navigator (they don't collapse to
zero height anymore).

For the above, line height (and so, <br><br> or <p> spacing) is now
calculated inside reformat_text_line_height, and is used with either
a token to get the text height at a given size (e.g. for general line
spacing or multiple BR tags) or NULL for normal size text (e.g. for
P spacing, though this value is in practice later scaled by 7/8ths in
reformat_check_height). Note this behaviour is exhibited by MSIE 4;
v3 gave two BRs the same spacing as one P (i.e. not font size
dependent).

Save dialogues can have an option button or couple of radios to
switch between various formats (e.g. URI or URL, sprite or original
format). See 'Docs.Notes' for more. The back-end to this is now
implemented (i.e. at the moment, save as URI or URL, save as original
image format). Note that when saving background images, a leafname
based on the original fetch URL is now offered rather than a generic
'Background'.

Internal URL scheme changed to be all lower case, so relativisation
through URL_Fetcher still makes sense... :-/

Holding down 'shift' when clicking on stop reverses the interpretation
of the Controls file 'StopWebServe' entry.

Fixed row / column count for exporting tables as text; fixed a few
bits and pieces of internal URL scheme stuff which got broken when
HTMLLib started using URL_Fetcher's relativisation.

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

1.2
log
@As warned in the last log, pretty much all event codes and component IDs
have now changed along with many of the names, to provide a consistent
name and numberspace for events and components. This also minimises
number clashes (e.g. as was, the Save File origin when opened from a
Hotlist menu with an already-used component ID). To get full details on
this, please carefully read through TBEvents.h.

Res files, Sprites files and Messages files have been updated again both
due to the above, and routine additions (e.g. message support for a few
Hotlist bits and pieces). !Run[D] files updated for FTP 0.11 and
HTTP 0.36.

In the Makefile, the Customer objects list was missing Save - must have
moved something when I should've copied it, when adding in SaveFile or
SaveObject in all probability. Now fixed. Couple of other bits and bobs
fixed in the build environment (e.g. stuff saying !Argo instead of
!Customer). Oh, and I've altered the MakeFile copy options again to the
best compromise I can come up with. Newer is turned on for everything
except !Run[D] and !RunImage, since both of those change between debug
builds - otherwise if you'd built debug and non-debug versions, it was
not possible to switch between them - one version would have the newer
timestamp and thus never get overwritten.

The default hotlist has had a few items added - that'll be about the end
of it, I think; there's more than enough stuff in there now.

Saving of the hotlist from the document menu and of URI files,
directories and selections from the hotlist menu tree is now implemented
- this new save system rocks... Oh, and you can save all images and
backgrounds as sprites.

Saving of items with Shift+Click to other applications directly now
works, and is robust. Unique Scrap filenames are used, with data load
bounces (e.g. if some pra - er, person quits the app they're sending
to) working correctly - that is, give an error, keep the file, rename
it to something safe, and open the directory it lies in. As opposed
to normal app-to-app bounces, where the scrap file is deleted (see
PRM 3-254). This means you can now look at README files in FTP
sites, say, without using a disc intermediate. Or you can send pictures
straight to ChangeFSI, fetch HTML links into editors, and so-on, and
so-on - it's all very funky. Known problems include the ambiguous
'invalid component ID' instead of 'file open' for *normal* (straight to
disc) shift+click saves, and I think I'll introduce a unique name
guarantee of some sort to stop 'file open' in the first place. Odd
that the really tricky part (app-to-app) should be least likely to
suffer from this!

log
@First a minor warning - the various Res files are out of sync in this build.
Only the Browse resources are currently valid.

Added Utils.Icons - has a few archives inside containing the resources
(well, some of them) used to build various UI sprites for various builds.
Archived because these are unlikely to change much, and putting them on
CVS was a move to, well, archive the stuff...

SaveDBox objects vanquished and requirements in !Run[D] files removed. The
data save code fits much more neatly in amongst the data load protocol
stuff now (with the slight exception of having to split the SaveObject
source into SaveObject and SaveFile - the former handles multiple persistent
dialogues for Shift+Click on links and the like, the latter handles 'one at
a time' transient dialogues for save source and similar). Export Link is now
supported, too, and writes a 'proper' version URI file. You'll find that
double-clicking on old URI files will work as the URI handler picks them up,
whilst new version ones don't; however, dragging onto the browser will only
work with new version files. Note that support for saving and loading URL
files (ANT suite stuff) is present too, so old URI files can be typed as URL
files if you want to keep them working without modification - the URI
handler itself will hopefully support the defined URI file format soon;
double-clicking on old URI files will stop working at that point. Note
there are *lots* of changes in every Res file to support all this. This may
all seem a bit pointless to some, but the changes do in fact make it very
easy to add new save dialogues all over the place. Certainly much easier
than with the previous system, anyway. In fact, post script, image
'save as sprite' took about half an hour, which I hope proves the worth
of the new system.

Merged in newer hotlist code with support for drag cancelling with Escape
(all relevant Res files appropriately updated) and cancelling scrolling
when you've reached the window scroll limit. Had to move some of the
Wimp message handling stuff to the central Protocols source, as clashes
were occuring, and also the hotlist routines were using independent saving
code - a lot of duplicated effort. This was fair enough as at the time the
Hotlist code was written, the Save code couldn't be used in the way it is
now.

New Save Source and Print buttons on the toolbar of some builds.

Phoenix Sprites file made more efficient - the Acorn base section has been
split from the animated upper region. Browse build has a new grey fade
sprite at the back, which is less grainy than the previous one and only
uses 16 colours (with a 16 greyscale palette).

Not really a bug, bug the routine to start an image fetch for INPUT
TYPE=IMAGE forms items only did so if the src field (or equivalent, for
this tag type) was non-NULL. In fact, you should always call image_new_image
and let that handle the rest, otherwise other sections of the code will fail
as they try to obtain an image number for a given HStream and get -1 back.
This problem only generally manifested itself when loading an HTML file to
the browser straight from an application, as many src fields become NULL
when the relativisation routines find nothing to relativise to...

Authentication got broken somewhere along the line - this has been fixed
(in HTMLLib and the browser).

Ctrl+Click on a cross referenced image updates *all* copies, not just the
one with the image data attached.

Next big step: Rip up TBEvents.h and rebuild that whole approach somewhat.
To all those working on the code, my apologies but this means all Res files
will receive a very large number of alterations and there will be extensive
code changes too (mostly naming convention stuff), in more or less all
source files. I am endeavouring to ensure that the new numberspace
convention does not clash with the work being done by Kevin on
internationalisation.
