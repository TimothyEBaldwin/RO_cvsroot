@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

Version 2.09. Tagged as 'Browse-2_09'

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Following the last check-in - all build resources brought up to date.

Adjust-click on forwards/backwards buttons did not work in the intermediate
build, and now does.

Adjust-click on form submission buttons where the submit method is POST
will now work correctly, as the new view inherits the extradata block
of the old. Failure of this is signalled through
make_no_fetch_memory_error, code 16 (see updated Errors file in Docs).
Note the name change of extradata in this context; more details below.

The passing of forms POST data and extra headers for sending in an
HTTP request via. the URL module was all done through pointers into
flex blocks, and was therefore very unsafe. All relevant functions now
use pointers to pointers to the data.

To remove confusion on the umpteen uses of the word 'extradata', the field
in browser_data has been renamed to 'post_data'. The 'extradata' parameters
used within FetchPage.c were all disconnected from the extra header info /
form POST data stuff that extradata is usually associated with, and have
thus also been renamed, in this case to 'appnddata' (Append Data).

As well as X-NoProxy, the browser sends the 'proper' HTTP headers
Pragma:no-cache and Cache-Control:no-cache.

A redirection from a POST request was not handled correctly; despite
what HTTP specs say, you're supposed to use GET for the new URL. The
browser was, but when it chopped off the redundant header data in the
request didn't terminate it and left Content-Type in anyway...! Fixed.

Ctrl+Tab implemented - URL completion. Comes from the hotlist URLs,
hotlist titles, history hosts, paths, full URLs and lastly titles.
See code comments for more (history_find_match, hotlist_find_match).

TableSupport option added to Choices; it is read, can be set by the
front-end, but doesn't actually do anything else yet.

Reversed Choices' semantics on 'don't expire by...' for History. Added
'needs_redraw' flag to choices_get_contents so that, for example, if the
table border types change, browsers get redrawn.

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

@Checking in mostly because its Friday... Quite a few little bug fixes
(adding up to a greater whole), which include removal of the dastardly
'invalid image number' errors that trace builds would raise from time to
time. Frame highlights are now better controlled (releaseably so).
Generally, this build represents the first genuinely promising version
of the browser for quite some time, despite the known library problems
with comment handling etc.
