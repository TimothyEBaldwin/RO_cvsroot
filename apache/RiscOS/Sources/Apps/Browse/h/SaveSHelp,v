64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

1.1
log
@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.
