64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

1.4
log
@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.

@Added MimeMap module support. OBJECT routines now use this to determine
if the item is an inline image, and if so pass it to the image routines.
At present, support relies on a (correct) content type.

1.2
log
@Version in Messages taken to 1.22 (03 Oct).

Updated Res files in appropriate builds to hold various (similar) Choices
designs.

Choices related menus were flagged as Shared, but none of the dialogues
(including ColourDBox) were - potential future problems, though shouldn't
cause any leaks at present. This has been sorted out anyway.

Encoding function encoding_init no longer returns an error from
toolbox_create_object, so the Encoding menu and all those attached
to it do not have to be present (e.g. the Customer build).

SUB, SUP, STRIKE and U supported. U underlines the baseline of the body text
font, whilst STRIKE will go through roughly the middle of the lower case
chars even if the font is SUP or SUB. Note that Navigator appears to shift
the underline point for SUB and SUP; it may be necessary to copy this
behaviour, but testing on real sites must proceed before that. There could
also be a problem with the automatic lowering of font size, which Navigator
doesn't do, so any FONT SIZE = -n commands could make it too small. Again,
this needs testing on real sites.

'http://' is added to URLs with no protocol specified, unless they start with
'ftp.', in which case the new behaviour is to add 'ftp://'.

Choices code altered to do less error checking on components! They should be
able to be missing without raising errors. Referencing of the subwindow
array changed from *(subwindows + number) to subwindows[number].

Made trace_tag_name code look pretty...

reformat_useless_token now checks tagno is non-zero.

User Agent string setting now done through URL_GetURL, on a per-session
basis.

Ellipsis character removed from all Messages files, replaced with '...'.
There's little difference between the two in an outline font, and in System
font the latter looks much better. Smart quotes left in, as they look
better in all cases.

1.1
log
@First a minor warning - the various Res files are out of sync in this build.
Only the Browse resources are currently valid.

Added Utils.Icons - has a few archives inside containing the resources
(well, some of them) used to build various UI sprites for various builds.
Archived because these are unlikely to change much, and putting them on
CVS was a move to, well, archive the stuff...

SaveDBox objects vanquished and requirements in !Run[D] files removed. The
data save code fits much more neatly in amongst the data load protocol
stuff now (with the slight exception of having to split the SaveObject
source into SaveObject and SaveFile - the former handles multiple persistent
dialogues for Shift+Click on links and the like, the latter handles 'one at
a time' transient dialogues for save source and similar). Export Link is now
supported, too, and writes a 'proper' version URI file. You'll find that
double-clicking on old URI files will work as the URI handler picks them up,
whilst new version ones don't; however, dragging onto the browser will only
work with new version files. Note that support for saving and loading URL
files (ANT suite stuff) is present too, so old URI files can be typed as URL
files if you want to keep them working without modification - the URI
handler itself will hopefully support the defined URI file format soon;
double-clicking on old URI files will stop working at that point. Note
there are *lots* of changes in every Res file to support all this. This may
all seem a bit pointless to some, but the changes do in fact make it very
easy to add new save dialogues all over the place. Certainly much easier
than with the previous system, anyway. In fact, post script, image
'save as sprite' took about half an hour, which I hope proves the worth
of the new system.

Merged in newer hotlist code with support for drag cancelling with Escape
(all relevant Res files appropriately updated) and cancelling scrolling
when you've reached the window scroll limit. Had to move some of the
Wimp message handling stuff to the central Protocols source, as clashes
were occuring, and also the hotlist routines were using independent saving
code - a lot of duplicated effort. This was fair enough as at the time the
Hotlist code was written, the Save code couldn't be used in the way it is
now.

New Save Source and Print buttons on the toolbar of some builds.

Phoenix Sprites file made more efficient - the Acorn base section has been
split from the animated upper region. Browse build has a new grey fade
sprite at the back, which is less grainy than the previous one and only
uses 16 colours (with a 16 greyscale palette).

Not really a bug, bug the routine to start an image fetch for INPUT
TYPE=IMAGE forms items only did so if the src field (or equivalent, for
this tag type) was non-NULL. In fact, you should always call image_new_image
and let that handle the rest, otherwise other sections of the code will fail
as they try to obtain an image number for a given HStream and get -1 back.
This problem only generally manifested itself when loading an HTML file to
the browser straight from an application, as many src fields become NULL
when the relativisation routines find nothing to relativise to...

Authentication got broken somewhere along the line - this has been fixed
(in HTMLLib and the browser).

Ctrl+Click on a cross referenced image updates *all* copies, not just the
one with the image data attached.

Next big step: Rip up TBEvents.h and rebuild that whole approach somewhat.
To all those working on the code, my apologies but this means all Res files
will receive a very large number of alterations and there will be extensive
code changes too (mostly naming convention stuff), in more or less all
source files. I am endeavouring to ensure that the new numberspace
convention does not clash with the work being done by Kevin on
internationalisation.
