64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@*Don't* try to load FilterManager 0.18 in !Run[D] files. Requires
WindowManager 3.98. Sets URI handler environment variables for
http, ftp and gopher.

Fixed 'doesn't reformat for unsized images' bug - only happens when the
deferred reformatter is enabled, hadn't remembered to check this in my
debug build where this is turned off. Oops.

Caret position in forms could get left behind despite attempts to rectify
this in v1.31 - now fixed (and faster, fortunately).

Hourglass + percentage displayed for History and Image History when
loading - it can take a while for very big histories, though in
practice you only see the visit history loading (has to do a lot
more work, and is thus quite a bit slower than the image history).

POST forms worked when targetted to frames, but were broken when
not targetted! (Forms data inherited from one browser to the same
browser; ended up freeing the flex block...). Fixed.

Now support 303 response code (redirect to GET). Treated as 301, i.e.
not support if STRICT_PARSER is defined, otherwise drops through to
the 302 handling code.

Pointer shouldn't get stuck in odd shapes when going to a new page now;
it gets reset to a standard shape every time the null handler that
checks the position is called, though (whether or not the handler thinks
the pointer is over a different token, if that token is NULL, it sets
the standard shape). A possible work around would be for a browser to
remember the pointer shape too; that's for the future, though.

Early stage table formatting functions could blow themselves apart if
tables_count_table decided there were no rows, columns or both. A
net table size of zero cells is now dealt with; slow, partial table
fetches in multiple windows with image loading turned on will now
*hopefully* be stable, where v1.31 would have bombed out repeatedly.

A nested frameset within one document will now inherit the border
width (frame spacing) and border colour of its parent. This is done
by copying the maxlen and indent fields of the parent token over
the child, and note it's done in the browser (fetch_preprocess_token),
not HTMLLib.

Border colour on a FRAMESET now used, with the first colour on any
FRAME within it overriding, as in NN 4 and MSIE 4.

<LI> bullets really do stick to the text next to them now (I'd done
that in an experimental piece of code and forgotten to merge it back
before the last check-in).

Browse$HotlistURL/URIFile and Browse$HomeURL/URIFile now work from
_TaskName in the Messages file, and are thus of the generic form
<App>$HotlistURL etc. - Docs.Notes and Docs.User updated appropriately.

Event 0x11d00 through to 0x11d7f will make the browser look up Controls
file entries 'JumpTo00' through to 'JumpTo7f' and read a URL from them.
This will be fetched in the ancestor window of the source of the event,
or a new window if such an ancestor can't be found [for Daytona demo].

NB: Nasty frames-related crash at http://www.teledanmark.dk/menu/start.htm
is *not* fixed in this source. NOBR is not supported.
