@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Everyone else seems to be checking lots of stuff in lately, so I've
decided to join in. This is an intermediate check-in and so not all
resources etc. will be up to date. You should be able to make Phoenix
and a debug build out of it. As a reminder, to make a JavaScript build:

 * Build JSLib and NSPRLib. Recommend you leave -DUSEMEMLIB in there (as
   used by default) so you can watch it leak into a dynamic area... :-)
   If you do this, you'll need to build MemLib too, of course. If you
   do NOT use MemLib, *undefine JS_USING_MEMLIB in Main.c*!
 * Run !MkClean. This now strips dynamic dependencies from the MakeFile
   automatically, to save you having to do it yourself.
 * Run one of the TaskObey files with the "J" suffix, e.g. !DeskBrwsJ -
   this uses the same .o directory for object files and exports to the
   same position in the Targets directory as the non-JavaScript build,
   but it does produce a unique binary in 'abs' and symbols table in
   'syms'.
 * Sourcing an appropriate !Run (with increased WimpSlot value), !Boot
   and About resource is done automatically.
 * Some, but not all of the !xxxD (debug) TaskObey files will make
   JavaScript versions in passing - check the JSUFFIX value on the Make
   command line parameters in the file.

This'll only work on RISC OS 3.1 due to the use of MemLib.

Here's the change list:

Included MNG icons in sprites files; added Sprites23 for some builds.
Added in ANT URL file icon (b28) derived from URI file icon, because
the Save dialogue can need it.

No, you do *not* need to define the same keyboard shortcuts in each
frame since the ancestor keeps the input focus and we've basically
dropped non-nested Wimp support. Maintaining no less than 4 lists of
identical shortcuts was a pain. Some Res files now only have the
lists in the main browser window and button bar objects (these two
are both required still).

Ursula build Markers button arrangement changed from 1x3 horizontal to
2x2 tilted, as in Phoenix, by popular demand.

Couple of hotlist bugs fixed; dragging an item and deleteing it with
Ctrl+X didn't terminate the drag, and deleteting an item underneath a
menu opened for it didn't close the menu.

'SendReferer' option added to all Choices files, all set to 'always'.
Put just beneath 'Clone' as it refers to header items, though really,
both Clone and SendReferer should probably be in the "Fetch controls"
section rather than "Multiuser environments and proxying"! Front-end
control of this is available.

In image_export_original, save_save_source, save_transfer_source and
save_save_object, flex_set_budge(0) was called to lock the heap but the
return value wasn't stored. flex_set_budge(1) was then used to unlock
the heap. All calls now remember and restore the old value, which is
both safer in case one calls another and allows the flex_set_budge
call in Main.c to have an application-wide meaning, as intended.

Some restructuring to the data load and RAM transfer sections of
Protocols.c; remote hotlist builds wouldn't allow files to be loaded
to browser windows before, and can now drop URL, URI or text files to
the Open URL dialogue.

New option "MinimumFontSize", lets the 'size' attribute of the 'font'
element be overridden. Default value is 1, to allow the full range of
values for the attribute. Setting to 7, for example, would give font
size 7 text at all times. Another new option, "ToggleOnXOnly", to
make Toggle Size only extend the window vertically (with Ctrl then
being used to toggle to genuine full size, rather than vice versa).
All Choices files updated to hold both of these options; only the
first has front-end control available (see debug build Res file).

JavaScript Document object exists; frames array etc. working. Can now
just about use "http://www.acorn.com/~ahodgkin/jschain/" but it does
abort after a bit - problems with frames again, I suspect. Is is pretty
slow, too. Can now press Escape to terminate a script.

Main.c erroneously referred to Controls file entry "StopWebServe" as
"StopWebProxy". Fixed.

Keyboard shortcuts to raise SaveFile are now possible in a general sense;
the code before was in the ToBeShown handler and just checked for a parent
component of -1. It then assumed "save frame HTML source". Now there's the
savefile_raise_from_shortcut function, which together with the seven new
event codes in SaveFile.h allows saving of HTML source and frame location,
export of links, images, backgrounds and the page as text or draw, to all
be invoked by keyboard shortcuts. Some Res files have some of these defined.

In reformat_check_height, the first check to see if setpara should be set
references a field in tpLast without checking if it is NULL. Whilst the
'line > 0' check should mean that tpLast wasn't NULL anyway, a direct
call to the function from outside of the reformatter might have tripped
up on this - the check for tpLast != NULL is now made.

Adjust-click on close icon in window showing file: URL attempts to open
the parent Filer window.

Reformatter used to try and find a selectable token if keyboard control
was enabled in a really stupid place - could make reformatting become
very slow if no selectables were present, especially if the page had a
few tables on it. Preprocessor now does this (since it goes through all
of the tokens anyway), the reformatter just doing a last check to ensure
no frames have obscured the selectable and if so, it tries to move it.
Done in the reformatter as generating a line array implies the data really
is visible.

Ctrl+Tab URL completion now builds a full list of matches from the hotlist
and history and can cycle through them (Ctrl+Shift+Tab stepping backwards).

Will give a real error rather than just "Data Abort" if it goes wrong
now. Someone somewhere is setting bit 30 of the error which confused
the replacement signal handler. Flag bits are now masked off (as they
should've been to start with).

@Image history - sizes of images are remembered for future reference (if
the sizes aren't specified in the HTML, they can be looked for in the
image history instead to minimise reformatting requirements). Choices
file options ImageHistoryPath, ImageExpiryAge, ImageMaxSize and
SaveImageHistory added to support this (all have a direct analogy to
the global History items of the same name after removing 'Image').

Text area items are now the correct height for the number of rows
specified in the HTML, don't scroll a line too early, and have the
caret placed at the start of the text when moved into from above
or at the end when moved into from below (rather than always at
the end, which was behaviour inherited from single line writables,
where this is desirable). The top of the text area is aligned to
the top of any line of text on the same line, with the text area
dropping below the text, rather than the bottom of the area matching
the text baseline and extending upwards.

Filename extensions for download files are only stripped if an
attempt to convert to a RISC OS filetype through the Mime Mapper module
does not return an error or Data (0xffd) filetype. '.cgi' is a special
case which is always stripped.

Altered heading styles - all are bold, none are italic, H3 is as big
as H2 was, H2 is a little larger, and others scale down to H6 being
the size as normal text (but, as I say, bold).

Sorted out tables and forms. We can just look for tagno=TAG_FORM, and
get rid of the wobbly form_flag; also discarded the redundant
reprocess_table flag in fetch_preprocess_token. Two separate forms
in consecutive table cells (for example) which used to fail - they
were submitted as one single form - will now work correctly.

Fixed nasty bug in FontManage.c where font size 7 would intermittently
fail. The stupid font sizes that it could ask the Font Manager for may
be responsible for the occasional Font Manager crashes that have been
noticed. Array for font sizes was declared as [Limits_FontSizes], but
indices 1 to Limits_FontSizes are actually used - so needed a '+ 1'
in the declaration... :-/

Replaced the case insensitive string comparison functions in Utils.c
with more efficient versions by S.Brodie.

MAXLENGTH specifier in INPUT tags is now supported. If unspecified or
specifically zero, the browser overrides and allows any length.

@Following the last check-in - all build resources brought up to date.

Adjust-click on forwards/backwards buttons did not work in the intermediate
build, and now does.

Adjust-click on form submission buttons where the submit method is POST
will now work correctly, as the new view inherits the extradata block
of the old. Failure of this is signalled through
make_no_fetch_memory_error, code 16 (see updated Errors file in Docs).
Note the name change of extradata in this context; more details below.

The passing of forms POST data and extra headers for sending in an
HTTP request via. the URL module was all done through pointers into
flex blocks, and was therefore very unsafe. All relevant functions now
use pointers to pointers to the data.

To remove confusion on the umpteen uses of the word 'extradata', the field
in browser_data has been renamed to 'post_data'. The 'extradata' parameters
used within FetchPage.c were all disconnected from the extra header info /
form POST data stuff that extradata is usually associated with, and have
thus also been renamed, in this case to 'appnddata' (Append Data).

As well as X-NoProxy, the browser sends the 'proper' HTTP headers
Pragma:no-cache and Cache-Control:no-cache.

A redirection from a POST request was not handled correctly; despite
what HTTP specs say, you're supposed to use GET for the new URL. The
browser was, but when it chopped off the redundant header data in the
request didn't terminate it and left Content-Type in anyway...! Fixed.

Ctrl+Tab implemented - URL completion. Comes from the hotlist URLs,
hotlist titles, history hosts, paths, full URLs and lastly titles.
See code comments for more (history_find_match, hotlist_find_match).

TableSupport option added to Choices; it is read, can be set by the
front-end, but doesn't actually do anything else yet.

Reversed Choices' semantics on 'don't expire by...' for History. Added
'needs_redraw' flag to choices_get_contents so that, for example, if the
table border types change, browsers get redrawn.

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

log
@Very long log entry alert - but hey, beats 'Bug fixed' (sorry, Richard) ;-)

Open URL implementation more or less complete, though may undergo UI
revision at a later date to allow named frames to be targetted. Hope to use
the ideas in this code as the foundation for other general dialogues.

In token stream dump for TRACE builds, table head items were not indented
as far as they should have been - this is fixed; and manual toolbar redraw
routines have been removed. They never worked, were commented out, and
would never be used in that form anyway.

DragBox source added, but it isn't at all complete and won't work - this is
an 'in spare time' thing. We need custom drag boxes constrained to windows
for the hotlist, and unconstrained for frame border resizing... Hey ho.

Ancestor window extents match visible areas if there are frames (no more
scrolling framesets...!). Frame resizing works whilst new documents fetch
without pulling the extent down now. However, frame horizontal extents
never shrink until a reload which is nasty, and this is all due for a
rewrite. Frames border redrawing routine moved out of Redraw.c and into
Frames.c. Bug regarding the mouse rectangle and frame border widths
(rectangle was too large, so you could squash the edges) for edge-drag
frame resizes fixed.

Window width change reformat tolerance fixed; you could creep the window
width down or up forever without any reformat, and centred objects would
move but not be redrawn (thereby giving rise to subsequent redraw errors).

Filetype on objects saved through Shift+Click correct. Save Source dialogue
recognises if that source is plain text, rather than assuming HTML. A
browser that fetches a file remembers the old store size it had before the
save, so even though the data is now ditched, it reports the same amount of
data fetched afterwards (looked awful when this could, for example,
suddenly say '0' after a file save). Progress indicator is now fully aware
of one or many file saves inside a frameset and reports the number of
saves, a colon, and the cumulative saved data count, instead of reporting
the sum total of fetched data in all frames, including non-file save stuff
(note that for just 1 save, '1:' is not shown as a special case for the
most common condition). A bug related to this, where you could in fact only
do one fetch per frame*set*, has been corrected (only one fetch allowed per
frame still, this is unlikely to ever change).

Hotlist support added (D.Brown's source), with various bits of integration
and modification still in progress there. Note additions to the Messages
files. On the subject of Messages, the whole mucky business about what
goes in Messages or Choices (and a few bugs where lookup_choice was used
instead of lookup_token or vice versa) has been sorted out. Messages
contains, more or less, just that. Choices contains user configurable
stuff which generally can't mess things up too badly. A new file, Controls,
is a Messages file holding the non-user configurable choices, which can
generally make things go badly wrong if misused. A lot of these are tied
to the Res file. StrongED users can get these to automatically fold out
the various sections (EMail me for details). Sorry, but at the time of
writing, Zap doesn't do folding... =8*P

Two bugs with images. Asking for images to be shown in browser B when
browser A uses the same ones and was loaded first didn't work correctly,
and now does (a bit weird - browser A does the fetch and browser B does the
display...). Second one occurred when the background image was also used on
the page as a foreground image. This has been fixed by flagging background
images in the image_info structure, and checking this before cross
referencing. This bit also allowed the image_restart_fetches API to be
extended, so that just background or foreground images may be fetched if
they weren't already and the user asked the browser to show them. Before,
the whole lot had to be fetched together (so turning on 'display
backgrounds' will now kick off an image fetch if required, you don't
need to reload the page anymore).

Makefile copy options tweaked to be 'newer' (so if you're testing with some
temporary Choices file or something, it won't write over it at the end of
every export), and REMOTE_HOTLIST flag added for Customer builds - means
the Hotlist.c functions aren't needed; the old, hotlist-by-file method is
used. Added support for Customer build (see later), though there were very
few additions needed in practice.

Table printing fixed - in many ways it wasn't broken, it was image printing
causing the oddities ever since the global image pool was introduced (this
is, again, fixed). The 'reformat to fit page' option didn't work as coded
any more; tables store cell addresses in the HStreams, so you can't then do
a background reformat in a different browser. Hence, it now has to reformat
to the page width, print, then put the page back again, all in the actual
displayed browser. This doesn't feel as slow in use as it perhaps should,
considering what is going on... Note that a line of a defined fraction (see
Print.h) of page height will now split over page boundaries, so tall images
or tall tables don't cause problems now (aside from the obvious problem of
having the line split over a page at all!). There was a bug in the routine
to print from a given start point until 'n' pages had been filled, in that
it always filled 'n + 1' - now fixed. Finally, as part of the printing
tweaks, a new dialogue exists - PrintStyle - with a similarly named source
file added to deal with it.

Global history auto save / load done, but only to the Choices file path -
the whole browser is still strictly single user at present, with all the
extra work for a multiuser Customer environment yet to be done. This has
shown up a global history corruption problem which I haven't fixed yet.

Rationalising TBEvents.h - things are migrating out of it, and into more
appropriate sources (e.g. definitions relating to the Open URL dialogue are
going into OpenURL.h, etc.). Event codes were at one stage deliberately
diverged in numberspace from the component IDs of typical gadgets raising
the events, to avoid anyone getting confused and thinking the IDs and event
codes must match. However, this is in fact unlikely and it is much easier
to remember the fewer numbers that result from tying the two together where
possible. This has resulted in changes to event codes raised in the
following objects of all Res files: Authorise, Find, OpenURL, and
PrintStyle.

And finally - !Run[D] files for all variants updated to require the latest
toolbox and fetcher modules. All Res files updated for hotlists etc. and
sprites files updated appropriately. All Messages, Choices and Controls
files brought in sync., and an Customer build has been added (based on the
Desktop build binary with different resources).

That's all for now...
