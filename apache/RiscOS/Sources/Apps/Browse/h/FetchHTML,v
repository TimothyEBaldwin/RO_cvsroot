64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Added capability to send Referer headers, together with new options to
allow this to be sent: a) Always, b) Never, c) when the URL referred to
is an http URL.  Default is c.  There is no frontend editing capability
for this option.  This addition means that various counters and sites
that rely on referer to indicate a resource upon which an operation is
to be carried out will now work (eg. rating a web site on Geocities).

@Following the last check-in - all build resources brought up to date.

Adjust-click on forwards/backwards buttons did not work in the intermediate
build, and now does.

Adjust-click on form submission buttons where the submit method is POST
will now work correctly, as the new view inherits the extradata block
of the old. Failure of this is signalled through
make_no_fetch_memory_error, code 16 (see updated Errors file in Docs).
Note the name change of extradata in this context; more details below.

The passing of forms POST data and extra headers for sending in an
HTTP request via. the URL module was all done through pointers into
flex blocks, and was therefore very unsafe. All relevant functions now
use pointers to pointers to the data.

To remove confusion on the umpteen uses of the word 'extradata', the field
in browser_data has been renamed to 'post_data'. The 'extradata' parameters
used within FetchPage.c were all disconnected from the extra header info /
form POST data stuff that extradata is usually associated with, and have
thus also been renamed, in this case to 'appnddata' (Append Data).

As well as X-NoProxy, the browser sends the 'proper' HTTP headers
Pragma:no-cache and Cache-Control:no-cache.

A redirection from a POST request was not handled correctly; despite
what HTTP specs say, you're supposed to use GET for the new URL. The
browser was, but when it chopped off the redundant header data in the
request didn't terminate it and left Content-Type in anyway...! Fixed.

Ctrl+Tab implemented - URL completion. Comes from the hotlist URLs,
hotlist titles, history hosts, paths, full URLs and lastly titles.
See code comments for more (history_find_match, hotlist_find_match).

TableSupport option added to Choices; it is read, can be set by the
front-end, but doesn't actually do anything else yet.

Reversed Choices' semantics on 'don't expire by...' for History. Added
'needs_redraw' flag to choices_get_contents so that, for example, if the
table border types change, browsers get redrawn.

@Updated Makefile to work better in folding text editors. More or less rewrote
Limits.h, and ensured consistent comment styling throughout all sources.
Fetch.c/h split to Fetch, FetchHTML and URLveneer. URLstat.c/h produced to
cope with this. OpenURL and Find sources created from bits in the Windows
source file that shouldn't have been there... These will get filled out
shortly. Note that a few functions in Fetch are due to be renamed and moved;
probably to Tokenutils.
