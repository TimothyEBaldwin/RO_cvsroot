@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Long overdue check-in of intermediate browser build, from continued "out
of hours" work. Forgot to add a few files last time too.

List dialogue box handler complete, and exclusion lists implemented
within the main browser code. Full documentation in Choices file.
Save routine knows all about it but is now getting very slow - must
come up with a better scheme; for now, it puts the hourglass on...

StripExtensions option controls auto stripping of filename extensions.

More sensible ancestor / frame selection for keyboard shortcut items
and the save dialogues - having selected a frame won't lock you into
it for F3 and related shortcuts now (input focus in URL writable ->
get ancestor details, input focus in frame -> get frame details). F4
works in frames. F5 now generally present for 'view source' with a
corresponding menu entry in the File menu.

Odd thing in later Res files; there's no action set for Adjust clicks
on the main ToolAction items in the button bar. Very odd. Nothing
appears to be set in v2.07 either, yet adjust-click works. Even
stranger. Anyway, added in the relevant event details (same as for
Select click in all cases) and this fixes the problem.

Background colours in the TABLE tag ignored the "don't print any
backgrounds" Print Style setting. Fixed. Meanwhile, the "black
text with no backgrounds" option wasn't getting this right either;
fixed this also.

Event logging implemented; HTTP errors and script output via.
window.print extension. No internal error output yet.

Faith:Never behaviour extended. If ever a server sends something with
no content type or an unhandleable type, the browser will try and get a
filetype from the URL. If it gets text or HTML, it'll render the file.
Else it'll save it. Hacks around IIS 4's lack of a content type field
in the Marketeye login stuff, and similar other slightly broken sites.

@Check for WindowManager 3.97 and ensure Unicode$Path is set in all
!Run[D] files, don't set the Alias$@@PrintType_FF4 variable, and updated
Customer build ROM obey file variants. Various other changes to
the Run files for new module versions, updated paths to support
new positions of choices, hotlist and histories (see later), etc.

!Sprites[22] files hold small !app icons for some variants, and
an ic_browse sprite. Some variants now have a Sprites and Sprites22
file instead of just Sprites, with the former containing various
mode 12 or 15 specific sprites.

Text files dragged to the URL writable are treated as ANT URL files. This
relies on URLBarWrit (Toolbars.h) being a unique ID, which it should be,
but beware of the Hotlist and Choices numberspaces...

INPUT TYPE=BUTTON supported. Form items without a FORM tag are now shown
(as MSIE 4, but not NN 4).

'*', '-', '@@', '_' and '.' are not escaped when submitting forms now. The
Web interface to the IMDb now works.

INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN items will not affect the line height anymore - so
http://www.hotmail.com/ now has correctly aligned writable icons, for
example. Similarly, TAG_FORM and TAG_FORM_END items could push up
line height and don't anymore.

HRs with a specified pixel width will now influence the size of a table
cell (they didn't before).

BRs now checked by tagno field when the browser needs to know something
was an actual BR tag rather than just a line break signal, and by the
style bit entry when only the indication of a line break is required.

Table widths of 0 or 0% are ignored.

Trace.c updated to report height and background fields in a table_stream.

fm_putsl() writes a terminator into the string; the Forms.c routines were
calling this for displaying INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD fields using the FE_PassCode
literal string (a line of stars). This write into a read only data area
would make the debugger fault the access. A local char array is now used
instead, to get round this (note the use of var[]=literal rather than
var[sizeof(literal)]; strcpy(var, literal) due to some weird compiler bug
that copies the wrong thing into 'var' under some (undefined...)
circumstances).

Text areas don't scroll back to the top line when clicked in anymore;
single line writables don't scroll back to the left either. When
reentering a text area from 'above', the caret appears at the top line
rather than 'somewhere further down'...

ARROWS_MOVE_OUT compile time option at the top of Forms.c defines whether
you must press Tab/Shift+Tab to move between writable fields in forms or
if up/down will drop out of them, though if keyboard control is on this
is enforced (or you get trapped inside the form!).

urlutils_filetype_from_url now uses MimeMap module.

If fetcher is told a page is text, it'll check for a filename extension and
may choose to use this instead (e.g. it may find it's HTML instead). This
is to try and get around duff servers... (e.g. http://www.batalarms.co.uk/).

Save dialogues shouldn't flicker when options that don't change the
filetype are selected (before, the draggable sprite was always reset for
each selection). Noticed the erroneous setting of a static variable in
SaveFile.c by a call to this by SaveObject.c, and so added a flag to
savefile_set_filetype to deal with this - would have been possible to get
the wrong filetype sent to applications or at best the wrong filetype
sprite in the dialogue without that.

The caret shouldn't jump out of a form back to the URL writable if the page
reformats now.

Table background colours now supported (as in the colour you see in the
border space if the cellspacing is large enough; this is as in MSIE, not
as in Navigator). Drawfile output routines updated accordingly.

Corrected erroneous use of wimpt_dx() / wimpt_dy() in a couple of places
in Images.c, which meant that (say) 1x1 images didn't work correctly in
medium resolution display modes.

Now have support for save as text (component ID and event 0x12) and save
as Draw (component ID and event 0x13) buttons. Dubious conditions for
greying and ungreying the print, save source and view source buttons and
menu options sorted out as part of implementing the same for the two new
buttons; added greying out of their associated menu items in passing.

Turned kerning on in draw file objects (does mean a rather heinous
increase in file size, but this is the only way to ensure the draw file
matches the visible page).

Comments before functions in SaveDraw.c are now complete and up to date.

Image and visit histories now generate a crude hash number to speed up
searching for items. It does give a speed increase, though it's a
disappointingly small one.

Issue of left/right margins and cellpaddings sorted out. Now have
redraw_left/right_margin for finding out the basic gap you must leave.
redraw_left/right_gap then gives any extra indentation for LI, BLOCKQUOTE
or whatever. The last two can be subtracted from the display width to
get an available page width for any section of text. Note that
redraw_left_gap replaces redraw_margin. The redraw_start_x function
uses the above to work out where a line's left hand edge should be,
taking account of left/right/centre alignment. HRs have been fixed now
(they were quite broken in v1.30, I think) based on this new model and
the behaviour of MSIE/NN 4.

Fixed width of cells with no contents - cell padding values wouldn't
have worked properly as the reformatter returns 0 rather than the left
hand margin size if given no stream.

Removed FM_Absolute flags for Font_Paint (spotted by DBrown) - sets bit
2, which is reserved...?

IMG width and height in % terms now works correctly; a % of available
width (after margins and indents) or height on the main page or for
a table cell, if the image lies in one. Because of the chicken-and-egg
problem with the latter, the cell must specify a width and/or height
for things to work properly. If this is not done, you'll usually end
up with a 1:1 scaled image (as in Navigator 4, rather than ending up
with no image or even no cell (!), as in MSIE 4).

HEIGHT attribute on a TABLE tag is supported, but only in a crude
fashion; the extra height (if there is any) is distributed over the
rows in a linear fashion. This is probably all you have to do in
practice, but I haven't checked. To maintain a notion of min/max
height as well as width would of course require a great deal more
work...

If using client pull to reload a page with a fragment ('...#name')
specified, then the reload wouldn't work on the same page; it'd just
jump to the fragment position. This won't happen if b->reloading is
set now (so works in conjunction with client pull on the same page
forcing a non-cached fetch). Similarly, if POSTing to such a URL,
a fetch will proceed (both these fixes done originally for
http://jupiter.beseen.com/chat/rooms/g/1678/).

browser_inherit split to browser_inherit and browser_inherit_post_data;
the code for the latter didn't clear any post_data in the child before
copying from the parent either, and could cause flex errors (now fixed).

Res file for Ursula ('Desktop' Browse) build tweaked - bits in the
font choices dialogue renamed, and button bar rearranged to hold the
new Save As Draw button. Other builds have had Save As Draw and
Save As Text buttons added, or not, depending upon availability of
suitable sprites, required UI simplicity, etc.

Now have:

  Browse$ChoicesFile
  Browse$ControlsFile
  Browse$ChoicesSave
  Browse$ControlsSave

(the last two are new) for loading and saving of the Choices or Controls
files. If unset, <App$Dir>.Choices or <App$Dir>.Controls will be set.
E.g., you could set Browse$ChoicesFile to be:

  <App$Dir>.Choices,Choices:WWW.(app).Choices

for loading and

  <Choices$Write>.WWW.(app).Choices

for saving. (The browser never saves Controls at the moment, so the
relevant variable above isn't effectively implemented, but could be
in future). Similarly, to support asymetric loading/saving of the Hotlist,
there are HotlistSave, HistorySave and ImageHistorySave entries in Choices
to complement HotlistPath, HistoryPath and ImageHistoryPath (which are used
for loading). save_save_choices will create directories as needed to obtain
the given path (and has also been fixed in various areas that hadn't been
tested out until now; e.g. zero termination of the AppName$ChoicesFile
variable expansion...). !Run[D] files updated appropriately.

Table widthing code rewritten. Slower, but a lot better on the whole.
Still has some problems - still needs a final 'make sure nothing is
below minimum width' scan, which it should be possible to do without.
No time to fix this at present!

The reformatter will now 'glue together' an LI token followed by any
non-LI token; so a bullet point followed by an item should not be able to
have a line break inserted after the bullet because of very tight width
constraints (it could before - yuk...).

'about:' brings up a page about the browser and any Plug-Ins, as with
Navigator (for example).

URI files support titles, as per spec. version 8. Saving a current
location to the Hotlist will thus give a sensible title now (unless
you're in a frame, so there's no title to get...). Of course, v1.00
files without a title still work.

Note that NOBR is *not* supported in this build and this combined with
the new table widther may cause problems on some sites (e.g. Microsoft's
home page!).

@There are a few known significant problems with this code but it's being
checked in so the Choices can be worked on. Note that Res files etc. are
not up to date across all builds. Progress is as follows...

Bug report prompted me to do this - now ignore <p> tags straight after
<li> tags, so '<ul><li><p>Some text' works as the author (or automatic
generator, more commonly) intended.

A <p> tag before a table will be acted upon now (it was ignored before).
Something like <li><p><table...> will give a line break and paragraph
space after the <li> despite the changes mentioned above, as in other browsers.
Both browsers differ from Navigator, where the table appears alongside
the <li> tag.

Multiple BR tags work as in MSIE / Navigator (they don't collapse to
zero height anymore).

For the above, line height (and so, <br><br> or <p> spacing) is now
calculated inside reformat_text_line_height, and is used with either
a token to get the text height at a given size (e.g. for general line
spacing or multiple BR tags) or NULL for normal size text (e.g. for
P spacing, though this value is in practice later scaled by 7/8ths in
reformat_check_height). Note this behaviour is exhibited by MSIE 4;
v3 gave two BRs the same spacing as one P (i.e. not font size
dependent).

Save dialogues can have an option button or couple of radios to
switch between various formats (e.g. URI or URL, sprite or original
format). See 'Docs.Notes' for more. The back-end to this is now
implemented (i.e. at the moment, save as URI or URL, save as original
image format). Note that when saving background images, a leafname
based on the original fetch URL is now offered rather than a generic
'Background'.

Internal URL scheme changed to be all lower case, so relativisation
through URL_Fetcher still makes sense... :-/

Holding down 'shift' when clicking on stop reverses the interpretation
of the Controls file 'StopWebServe' entry.

Fixed row / column count for exporting tables as text; fixed a few
bits and pieces of internal URL scheme stuff which got broken when
HTMLLib started using URL_Fetcher's relativisation.

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

@Choices and Controls files are now loaded into malloc space (use chf and
cof to address them). Previously only in Main.c, task_dir is now globally
visible.

Choices updated to allow 16ths of a point in the font size specification
and the System font face has been removed - it isn't used. The use of
serif and sans serif fonts has been rationalised across builds (e.g. Desktop
builds use what they say, but the Customer build uses Homerton as the
default body (serif, so to speak) font as it matches the box's look and
feel better).

Font loading altered a bit to work properly! Font library defines some
standard startup fonts without using Choices, which Choices can then
override.

log
@As warned in the last log, pretty much all event codes and component IDs
have now changed along with many of the names, to provide a consistent
name and numberspace for events and components. This also minimises
number clashes (e.g. as was, the Save File origin when opened from a
Hotlist menu with an already-used component ID). To get full details on
this, please carefully read through TBEvents.h.

Res files, Sprites files and Messages files have been updated again both
due to the above, and routine additions (e.g. message support for a few
Hotlist bits and pieces). !Run[D] files updated for FTP 0.11 and
HTTP 0.36.

In the Makefile, the Customer objects list was missing Save - must have
moved something when I should've copied it, when adding in SaveFile or
SaveObject in all probability. Now fixed. Couple of other bits and bobs
fixed in the build environment (e.g. stuff saying !Argo instead of
!Customer). Oh, and I've altered the MakeFile copy options again to the
best compromise I can come up with. Newer is turned on for everything
except !Run[D] and !RunImage, since both of those change between debug
builds - otherwise if you'd built debug and non-debug versions, it was
not possible to switch between them - one version would have the newer
timestamp and thus never get overwritten.

The default hotlist has had a few items added - that'll be about the end
of it, I think; there's more than enough stuff in there now.

Saving of the hotlist from the document menu and of URI files,
directories and selections from the hotlist menu tree is now implemented
- this new save system rocks... Oh, and you can save all images and
backgrounds as sprites.

Saving of items with Shift+Click to other applications directly now
works, and is robust. Unique Scrap filenames are used, with data load
bounces (e.g. if some pra - er, person quits the app they're sending
to) working correctly - that is, give an error, keep the file, rename
it to something safe, and open the directory it lies in. As opposed
to normal app-to-app bounces, where the scrap file is deleted (see
PRM 3-254). This means you can now look at README files in FTP
sites, say, without using a disc intermediate. Or you can send pictures
straight to ChangeFSI, fetch HTML links into editors, and so-on, and
so-on - it's all very funky. Known problems include the ambiguous
'invalid component ID' instead of 'file open' for *normal* (straight to
disc) shift+click saves, and I think I'll introduce a unique name
guarantee of some sort to stop 'file open' in the first place. Odd
that the really tricky part (app-to-app) should be least likely to
suffer from this!

@First a minor warning - the various Res files are out of sync in this build.
Only the Browse resources are currently valid.

Added Utils.Icons - has a few archives inside containing the resources
(well, some of them) used to build various UI sprites for various builds.
Archived because these are unlikely to change much, and putting them on
CVS was a move to, well, archive the stuff...

SaveDBox objects vanquished and requirements in !Run[D] files removed. The
data save code fits much more neatly in amongst the data load protocol
stuff now (with the slight exception of having to split the SaveObject
source into SaveObject and SaveFile - the former handles multiple persistent
dialogues for Shift+Click on links and the like, the latter handles 'one at
a time' transient dialogues for save source and similar). Export Link is now
supported, too, and writes a 'proper' version URI file. You'll find that
double-clicking on old URI files will work as the URI handler picks them up,
whilst new version ones don't; however, dragging onto the browser will only
work with new version files. Note that support for saving and loading URL
files (ANT suite stuff) is present too, so old URI files can be typed as URL
files if you want to keep them working without modification - the URI
handler itself will hopefully support the defined URI file format soon;
double-clicking on old URI files will stop working at that point. Note
there are *lots* of changes in every Res file to support all this. This may
all seem a bit pointless to some, but the changes do in fact make it very
easy to add new save dialogues all over the place. Certainly much easier
than with the previous system, anyway. In fact, post script, image
'save as sprite' took about half an hour, which I hope proves the worth
of the new system.

Merged in newer hotlist code with support for drag cancelling with Escape
(all relevant Res files appropriately updated) and cancelling scrolling
when you've reached the window scroll limit. Had to move some of the
Wimp message handling stuff to the central Protocols source, as clashes
were occuring, and also the hotlist routines were using independent saving
code - a lot of duplicated effort. This was fair enough as at the time the
Hotlist code was written, the Save code couldn't be used in the way it is
now.

New Save Source and Print buttons on the toolbar of some builds.

Phoenix Sprites file made more efficient - the Acorn base section has been
split from the animated upper region. Browse build has a new grey fade
sprite at the back, which is less grainy than the previous one and only
uses 16 colours (with a 16 greyscale palette).

Not really a bug, bug the routine to start an image fetch for INPUT
TYPE=IMAGE forms items only did so if the src field (or equivalent, for
this tag type) was non-NULL. In fact, you should always call image_new_image
and let that handle the rest, otherwise other sections of the code will fail
as they try to obtain an image number for a given HStream and get -1 back.
This problem only generally manifested itself when loading an HTML file to
the browser straight from an application, as many src fields become NULL
when the relativisation routines find nothing to relativise to...

Authentication got broken somewhere along the line - this has been fixed
(in HTMLLib and the browser).

Ctrl+Click on a cross referenced image updates *all* copies, not just the
one with the image data attached.

Next big step: Rip up TBEvents.h and rebuild that whole approach somewhat.
To all those working on the code, my apologies but this means all Res files
will receive a very large number of alterations and there will be extensive
code changes too (mostly naming convention stuff), in more or less all
source files. I am endeavouring to ensure that the new numberspace
convention does not clash with the work being done by Kevin on
internationalisation.

@File fetches now set DEADDEAD during the fetch, Data if it is aborted, or
an appropriate filetype when finished. If the fetcher routines return a
zero or data filetype, the browser looks at a set of hard coded filename
extensions to try and determine if there's a better filetype to use
(urlutils_filetype_from_url) - since this is a centralised routine it can
use a Mime mapping system (or be removed entirely) as and when one becomes
available.

You can now drag URI / URL files to the Hotlist window to add them to the
list. They are added roughly where dragged to. (NB, note that I renamed
the function to return the window ID - just being picky; it matches other
similar functions now). Oh, and hotlist_add_position actually works now ;-)

The global history will save when titles are added, as well as when a URL
is added. Before, a browser crash could mean a title got dropped out
of the history file even if SaveHistory was set to 'always'.

SaveObject sources have been added but nothing references them or links
them in yet - they're not finished. Mostly checking this one in because
of the hotlist changes.

@Created Protocols source file and moved a lot of message handling from
handle_messages - the latter now serves as a high level distributor to
lower level functions in Protocols. Incidentally, URL files (as used by
the ANT suite) can be loaded by dragging to the browser in the same way
as URI files - Not A Lot Of People Know That, etc.

Merged new hotlist display type Res file to existing resources, added
support for DataSave message so items can be dragged from the hotlist
to a specific window (RAM transfer for URI and URL files; ScrapFile for
HTML and Text but deleted afterwards and there are appropriate guards
to stop Reload just saying 'not found'; images run through ScrapFile and
there is no choice but to leave them there and do a conventional fetch).

All !RunD files now give a WimpSlot of 2304K. Some small changes to
the Argo and Ursula build Res files to make the menu trees more sensible.
Controls files now take 'file:/' instead of 'file://' in Protocols
section. Definitions at top of URLutils.c *not* altered, as then you
end up with invalid URLs - so it will accept 'file:/', but always generate
'file://'. This is because some browsers exports 'file:/'. Sigh.

make_no_[..._]memory_error functions now return a _kernel_oserror * rather
than void. It's always &erb returned, but it enables users to use a more
elegant 'return make_no_memory_error(1);', say, rather than something
like 'make_no_memory_error(1); return &erb;'. I obviously should've written
it like that at the outset, but never mind. All callers have been
appropriately updated.

The urlutils_leafname_from_url function now replaces illegal characters
(A7000 Welcome Guide p54...) in the leaf with legal alternatives.

Internal URL scheme is now a bit cleaner, with everything properly defined
in URLutils.h. All references to http:, file: and ftp:, with or without
a following '//' use the definitions in here now.

More tidying and some reorganising of Hotlist source. Auto-open delay is
now a Choices item. Some dependencies on statics removed (e.g. the
counting functions don't accumulate into the global item_number now).
The redraw functions used Wimp_TextOp - oops, so this has been amended
to use whatever is supported on your Wimp. This is now in a new function
(utils_text_width()), which the History menu routines also use (there was
a bug in the width routine there anyway, which is therefore fixed in
passing). Several other routines used Wimp_TextOp directly too, and
they have been altered to use the new function as well.

In hotlist code, one of the larger changes is in the API to hotlist_draw_r()
(formerly _hotlist_draw()) which now takes item widths and heights as
parameters - discovering these is quite slow, so doing it every time the
function calls itself recursively is a little less efficient than
passing the values in from elsewhere. Note that underscore prefixed
functions are being slowly renamed to _r suffixed functions, to match
the convention established by Tony Cheal with is table routines. This
makes it much more obvious when something is recursive, as the same
naming convention is used in every browser source file.

Finally, note that I intend to ditch SaveDBox and use an alternate window
with manual control of the messaging in Protocols.c. This will allow
various improvements which at present the SaveDBox operational methods
preclude. I'm going to have to do at least an alternate Window object for
the SaveDBox module to use soon in any case. Getting rid of SaveDBox will
help reduce, if only slightly, demands on the RMA.

@Very long log entry alert - but hey, beats 'Bug fixed' (sorry, Richard) ;-)

Open URL implementation more or less complete, though may undergo UI
revision at a later date to allow named frames to be targetted. Hope to use
the ideas in this code as the foundation for other general dialogues.

In token stream dump for TRACE builds, table head items were not indented
as far as they should have been - this is fixed; and manual toolbar redraw
routines have been removed. They never worked, were commented out, and
would never be used in that form anyway.

DragBox source added, but it isn't at all complete and won't work - this is
an 'in spare time' thing. We need custom drag boxes constrained to windows
for the hotlist, and unconstrained for frame border resizing... Hey ho.

Ancestor window extents match visible areas if there are frames (no more
scrolling framesets...!). Frame resizing works whilst new documents fetch
without pulling the extent down now. However, frame horizontal extents
never shrink until a reload which is nasty, and this is all due for a
rewrite. Frames border redrawing routine moved out of Redraw.c and into
Frames.c. Bug regarding the mouse rectangle and frame border widths
(rectangle was too large, so you could squash the edges) for edge-drag
frame resizes fixed.

Window width change reformat tolerance fixed; you could creep the window
width down or up forever without any reformat, and centred objects would
move but not be redrawn (thereby giving rise to subsequent redraw errors).

Filetype on objects saved through Shift+Click correct. Save Source dialogue
recognises if that source is plain text, rather than assuming HTML. A
browser that fetches a file remembers the old store size it had before the
save, so even though the data is now ditched, it reports the same amount of
data fetched afterwards (looked awful when this could, for example,
suddenly say '0' after a file save). Progress indicator is now fully aware
of one or many file saves inside a frameset and reports the number of
saves, a colon, and the cumulative saved data count, instead of reporting
the sum total of fetched data in all frames, including non-file save stuff
(note that for just 1 save, '1:' is not shown as a special case for the
most common condition). A bug related to this, where you could in fact only
do one fetch per frame*set*, has been corrected (only one fetch allowed per
frame still, this is unlikely to ever change).

Hotlist support added (D.Brown's source), with various bits of integration
and modification still in progress there. Note additions to the Messages
files. On the subject of Messages, the whole mucky business about what
goes in Messages or Choices (and a few bugs where lookup_choice was used
instead of lookup_token or vice versa) has been sorted out. Messages
contains, more or less, just that. Choices contains user configurable
stuff which generally can't mess things up too badly. A new file, Controls,
is a Messages file holding the non-user configurable choices, which can
generally make things go badly wrong if misused. A lot of these are tied
to the Res file. StrongED users can get these to automatically fold out
the various sections (EMail me for details). Sorry, but at the time of
writing, Zap doesn't do folding... =8*P

Two bugs with images. Asking for images to be shown in browser B when
browser A uses the same ones and was loaded first didn't work correctly,
and now does (a bit weird - browser A does the fetch and browser B does the
display...). Second one occurred when the background image was also used on
the page as a foreground image. This has been fixed by flagging background
images in the image_info structure, and checking this before cross
referencing. This bit also allowed the image_restart_fetches API to be
extended, so that just background or foreground images may be fetched if
they weren't already and the user asked the browser to show them. Before,
the whole lot had to be fetched together (so turning on 'display
backgrounds' will now kick off an image fetch if required, you don't
need to reload the page anymore).

Makefile copy options tweaked to be 'newer' (so if you're testing with some
temporary Choices file or something, it won't write over it at the end of
every export), and REMOTE_HOTLIST flag added for Customer builds - means
the Hotlist.c functions aren't needed; the old, hotlist-by-file method is
used. Added support for Customer build (see later), though there were very
few additions needed in practice.

Table printing fixed - in many ways it wasn't broken, it was image printing
causing the oddities ever since the global image pool was introduced (this
is, again, fixed). The 'reformat to fit page' option didn't work as coded
any more; tables store cell addresses in the HStreams, so you can't then do
a background reformat in a different browser. Hence, it now has to reformat
to the page width, print, then put the page back again, all in the actual
displayed browser. This doesn't feel as slow in use as it perhaps should,
considering what is going on... Note that a line of a defined fraction (see
Print.h) of page height will now split over page boundaries, so tall images
or tall tables don't cause problems now (aside from the obvious problem of
having the line split over a page at all!). There was a bug in the routine
to print from a given start point until 'n' pages had been filled, in that
it always filled 'n + 1' - now fixed. Finally, as part of the printing
tweaks, a new dialogue exists - PrintStyle - with a similarly named source
file added to deal with it.

Global history auto save / load done, but only to the Choices file path -
the whole browser is still strictly single user at present, with all the
extra work for a multiuser Customer environment yet to be done. This has
shown up a global history corruption problem which I haven't fixed yet.

Rationalising TBEvents.h - things are migrating out of it, and into more
appropriate sources (e.g. definitions relating to the Open URL dialogue are
going into OpenURL.h, etc.). Event codes were at one stage deliberately
diverged in numberspace from the component IDs of typical gadgets raising
the events, to avoid anyone getting confused and thinking the IDs and event
codes must match. However, this is in fact unlikely and it is much easier
to remember the fewer numbers that result from tying the two together where
possible. This has resulted in changes to event codes raised in the
following objects of all Res files: Authorise, Find, OpenURL, and
PrintStyle.

And finally - !Run[D] files for all variants updated to require the latest
toolbox and fetcher modules. All Res files updated for hotlists etc. and
sprites files updated appropriately. All Messages, Choices and Controls
files brought in sync., and an Customer build has been added (based on the
Desktop build binary with different resources).

That's all for now...
