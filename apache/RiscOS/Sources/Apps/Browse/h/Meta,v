@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

Version 2.09. Tagged as 'Browse-2_09'

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@Sorted out Res files, including fixing position of 'bytes' label in one
of the Choices dialogues (I'd missed it out of a selection when everything
else got moved down a bit). Unfaded Enc_Chinese menu entries, made sure
text labels were wide enough for system font, changed 'Apply' on Choices
dialogue to 'Set', and added ^K to hotlist keyboard shortcut lists.
Print Setup (i.e. Print dialogue) buttons all set to 'local', so the
stupid Toolbox doesn't close the dialogue and lose the caret before I
can see if it was in there to start with...

256 colour hotlist sprites taken back to standard 16 colour versions,
since there's a significant speed penalty on slower machines. The
testbed browser still has the 256 colour versions so the designs aren't
completely lost.

Changed access settings to exported builds to wr/r - lr/r was really getting
on my nerves whenever I wanted to try something temporary out.

View source, save source and print handlers would all try to work if
there was no source to act on - despite the fact that toolbar buttons
would be greyed out form them. This is fixed.

The Navigate menu has components greyed to match the toolbar state,
when opened. It isn't kept up to date dynamically, though this shouldn't
really be a problem (reopen the submenu...). As part of this, finally
sorted out conditions for the Stop button to be greyed, or the
GoTo/Go/Stop tristate to be at 'Stop' versus 'GoTo'.

Deferred reformatting is now disabled for external image fetches.

Browser-local client pull flag removed; hitting the Stop button simply
cancels any null handlers working for it. That way, client pull switches
back on in passing at the next fetch (it was never really switched off).
So to stop client pull, hit the stop button at any point.

Done CELLPADDING attribute; cellpadding field in reformat_cell (Global.h)
is redundant since the table token is accessible from there, and so it has
been removed. CELLSPACING support also added.

@Forgot to add the JavaScript, Customer and Meta source files at last
check in...! Put in a few utilities in a new Utils directory also, which
includes a TaskObey script that will take a backup of the Makefile, strip
out the dependencies list, and (assuming the CVS call doesn't crash),
restore the Makefile with dependencies intact from the backup.
