64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@All !Run[D], Choices, Messages, Controls and Res files are up to date.

RefoKeep and RefoHold options added to, respectively, try and maintain
the line at the top of the visible area when reformatting, and not shrink
the vertical extent at the start of a reformat to try and avoid flicker
to the top of the page and back down again when RefoKeep is on. Choices
front-end implemented, which also allows RefoWait and RefoTime to be set.
Unfortunately for various reasons this doesn't help the page jumping when
unsized images come in (but RefoHold can improve matters...) - roll on
the image history.

DragToScroll and NoScrollBars options added for frames; included new
pointer type, Mouse_Shape_DTS, so relevant Controls file entries done
and Sprites[22] files updated as required. Noticed some builds have
a low-res ptr_link with a mask - mask removed.

Named anchor following fixed up somewhat - anchors near the bottom of
the page shouldn't be displayed, and then pulled down when the fetcher
releases null polls and ensures the y extent is correct (this through
implementing the min_height field in the browser_data structure).

RefoHang was never implemented and there seems little point to it now,
so the entry for it has been removed from the global choices structure
and all Choices files.

Markers menus should work properly now (in last check-in they would not
update correctly if Adjust was used on the entries).

URI handler usage now a lot more sensible, with configuration of how the
browser uses the module from both a Utils menu submenu (sic) and the
Choices dialogue.

Slightly dodgy 'hang around waiting for user input' stuff for the Cookies
dialogue box: All fetches are suspended; the fetcher remembers some info
about its state at the time the cookie came in, and restores it later; it
will only do this for one fetch at a time. It's necessary to single-thread
the fetcher at this point anyway, since other fetches may have a
dependency on the cookie that is hanging in mid-air at that point. As part
of this, some of the fetcher code has been split out into separate
functions (to try and 'black box' the code a bit). Anyway, Cookie Query
dialogue box now implemented with appropriate Choices file entry and
UI work in the Choices dialogue box.

Phoenix build Choices rearranged. Can now choose when the image history
is saved from the front end. Added also MSIE 4-style table option menu
for JPEG support (OS only, OS if it can handle it, internal only).

Should be a bit faster at loading the history - though 95% of the time
is spent in SWI URL_ParseURL. URL descriptions are stored more
efficiently as part of this - one malloc block instead of several
small blocks. The minimum block size for malloc blocks typically leads
to a significantly smaller startup wimpslot depending on the visit
history size.

Nasty bug in image system fixed. If an image size came in and a reformat
was to take place, the line the image lies in is found and the reformat
progresses from there. Unforunately, this didn't check to see if the
token can't be found in the line list, so it'd reformat from the top
of the page...! This would happen if, for example, an image halfway down
the page came in whilst a reformat for an image higher up had just begun.

In Choices.c, made choices_set_timetype_field, choices_set_uri_field,
choices_set_plugin_field, choices_set_cookie_field, and
choices_set_jpeg_field static (so they're not declared in Choices.h now).

Two memory leaks plugged in URL comparison routines in URLutils.c
(calling free() url_description instead of urlutils_free_descripton()).

Client pull reload handler was setting the reload flag if reloading
the same page, but forgetting to turn on reload_lock so
fetchpage_postprocessed was clearing the reload state... Similarly,
Ctrl+Shift+SELECT-Click on a link when the Controls file 'UseSmall'
entry is 'no' would not have reloaded as it should. Both fixed.

Frames shouldn't be so keen on acquiring horizontal scroll bars and never
letting them go when their width is decreased now. Frames set up for
'scrolling="yes"' will not start with no scroll bars and then gain them
shortly afterwards, causing flicker and two reformats - they'll start
with, and continue to hold, both scroll bars.

Pointer shouldn't flicker when over a frame border whilst other fetches
are progressing now.

@This is NOT a 'final' version of anything in particular. I'm checking it
in as I'm about to start playing around with low level window handling
(as part of the thing mentioned at the bottom of this log) - this could
screw things up quite badly if it goes wrong! =8*P

Consequently, I advise you not to check this out over your working sources,
and preferably not to check this out at all.

Markers system - events defined in MiscEvents.h will make Browse remember
where it is on the page. This position can be jumped back to later.
Some builds will have defined keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+F5 through
F8 to set a marker, and Ctrl+F5 through F8 to jump to a marker.

The front-end for the above now has gadgets 0x80 upwards on the Toolbar or
a set of menus (see Menus.h). Noticed an omission in copy_toolaction_info()
(didn't copy the gadget state) in passing; fixed.

browser_top_line() now works properly, as part of the above, but it'll be
slower than before. If flagged to only find a complete line, it'll do just
that, but whereas before this would require any tables that it looked
inside to be wholly visible, tables can now be partially visible and have
lines inside that are fully visible. This should help the Find function
too. There is a new call, browser_top_line_offset, which works as
browser_top_line but also returns a vertical scroll offset in the found
line (used for more accurate marker position). browser_bottom_line[_r]
turn out to never be used, even by the keyboard control routines, so they
have been removed from Browser.c (rather than spend a lot of time and
effort fixing them).

browser_show_token erroneously subtracted 1 from a particular coordinate
when calculating the y scroll position, which could lead to single pixel
page creep using the markers system. Corrected.

The View Resources button (see Toolbars.h) has been finally implemented,
insofar as it fetches the resources file to the current browser page (or
to a new window if Adjust is used, Controls file settings permitting).

menus_toggle_bars did not take account of the toolbar lower window border
edge correctly. It does now.

The reformatter has a prototype system to keep the vertical page position
when reformatting. This was coded about 5 minutes ago, and is not likely
to be reliable...
