64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

@Big steps forward in vertical white space handling as a result of
improvements in HTMLLib in this area ( -> all versions now 1.22 beta-2).
As a result, the 'last_space' field in browser_data struct has been
removed. Note that this relies quite heavily on setting of the PCDATA
bit in the 'style' field of an HStream and the automatic collapsing
of (for example) multiple P tags inside HTMLLib.

Trace.c improved to recognise various bits in the 'style' field of an
HStream structure.

Phoenix defaults altered to a more 'standard' set of choices; Trinity
as the serif font, with a slightly larger default font size. This is
because there's a good chance it might get released to a wider audience
than Acorn internal (though the animation and icon bar sprites will
have to change before then...).

MiscDefs updated for new SWI numbers in HTTP module; !Run[D] files thus
updated to require HTTP 0.42 or later. At this point, all earlier
modules are not backwards compatible in terms of direct calls to the
HTTP module, though this only affects cookies_process_cookie at present.
At the same time, checks for System$Path, InetDBase$Path, and setting
of Inet$MimeMappings if not already defined have been added to the Run
files along with RMEnsures of Resolver and MimeMap.

Object and PlugIn c/h pairs created to handle OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET,
and the RISC OS Plug-In interface respectively. Not part of the build
process yet. Addition of 'odata' field in browser_data struct and
definition of chunk CK_OBJB for memory_set_chunk_size() are in support
of this.
