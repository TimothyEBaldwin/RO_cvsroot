@  Load balancer pulled apart. DebugLib support. Temporary debug in place.
Detail:
  This is in the middle of some load balancer changes, but I'm checking it
  in as there's a sweeping source code change to use DebugLib. See Global.c
  for full details. Temporary debug code for the load balancer stuff is
  currently held under undocumented area "test".
Admin:
  This build now identifies itself as 2.08 i2-4 and says Pace on the about:
  page. Run for some time with no unexpected problems. Tried a mixture of
  debug levels successfully.

Version 2.08. Not tagged

@# User-configurable choices
# =========================
#
# These may not be freely internationalised - the values of the tokens,
# where strings, are compared directly inside the browser. Since the user
# should edit this through a dialogue, it is that dialogue's contents which
# should be internationalised. Changing the values here to foreign ones
# requires the code to be appropriately altered and recompiled.

# URLs
# ====
#
# HomePage         - The URL that the browser defaults to on loading.

HomePage:http://www.acorn.co.uk/browser/

# Page colours
# ============
#
# BackColour       - Background colour; 0xBBGGRR00 where RR GG BB are red, green,
#                    and blue values as two digit hex numbers from 0 to 255. It
#                    doesn't matter if the hex digits are upper or lower case. If
#                    the syntax is wrong, very unpredictable effects could occur.
# TextColour       - Text colour, defined as BackColour.
# LinkColour       - Link colour, defined as BackColour.
# UsedColour       - Used (followed) link colour, defined as BackColour.
# FollColour       - Colours links flash to when clicked on, before being
#                    followed.
# SeleColour       - Colours objects adopt or are bordered in if selected /
#                    highlighted.

# Tables
# ======
#
# SupportTables    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' tables are handled, else table
#                    tags are ignored and the document is rendered in a linear
#                    fashion.
# MSIE4StyleTables - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' tables will be rendered in a manner
#                    similar to Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer(TM) 4. This will
#                    mostly affect widthing issues - e.g. a table specified to
#                    be 100% wide, but located inside an indented list, will
#                    be a different width with this turned on compared with when
#                    it is turned off.
# TableOuter       - Changes the way the outer border around tables is plotted.
#                    '2d', 'auto', '3d' or 'never', for always 2D, automatic
#                    selection depending on screen resolution and CELLSPACING,
#                    always 3D, or never plot the borders (but leave space for
#                    them to ensure page layouts relying on this still work).
# TableInner       - As TableOuter but for inner (i.e. cell) borders.

SupportTables:yes
MSIE4StyleTables:yes
TableOuter:auto
TableInner:auto

# JavaScript (JS), JavaScript builds only... (Visit URL 'about:')
# ===============================================================
#
# SupportJS        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then the JavaScript interpreter
#                    is enabled, else it is not and scripts etc. will not
#                    be executed.
# JSWatchdog       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then the watchdog (JS branch
#                    callback function) timer will be enabled. If a script is
#                    taking a long time to execute it will eventually prompt
#                    to see if it should continue, though at any time you can
#                    press Escape to abort the script in any case. If 'no',
#                    the script can run forever should you so wish - useful
#                    if you've a heavy processing script that you know will
#                    take a long time to complete.
# JSTimeout        - A number in centiseconds. If JSWatchdog is 'yes', this
#                    is the length of time the system waits before asking if
#                    the script should be aborted. If the watchdog timer is
#                    disabled this option is ignored anyway.

SupportJS:no
JSWatchdog:yes
JSTimeout:1000

# Font usage
# ==========
#
# FontSize         - Default font size, in 16ths of a point.
# TTAspect         - Aspect ratio for teletype style text (in %).
# SystemFont       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' browser will only use system font on
#                    the page (fast and clear, but pretty ugly...).
# MinimumFontSize  - Between 1 and 7, normally 1. This is the smallest font size
#                    as specified by <font size="..."> in HTML that Browse will
#                    use. If you find that web pages use font sizes of 2 or 1 too
#                    much, making them hard to read, you can use this to alleviate
#                    the situation.
# Typeface1        - Typeface definitions. The syntax of these is fairly
# Typeface2          strict and slightly complex, so they should only
# Typeface3          be altered through a front-end dialogue in the
#                    browser.
# Encoding         - Default document character set encoding to use. This is as
#                    follows (these are Internet MIB numbers):
#
#                       3: US-ASCII

# Page display
# ============
#
# ShowForeground   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' foreground images will be fetched

# UnderlineLinks   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' link text will be underlined.
# UseSourceCols    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' any document-specified colours will

# Page layout
# ===========
#
# LeftMargin       - Basic left hand page margin (before list indents etc.), in
#                    millipoints.
# RightMargin      - Similarly, the basic right hand page margin in millipoints.
# QuoteMargin      - Extra page margin for a <blockquote> section of text.
# Leading          - Line spacing in OS units (pronounced 'ledding'). Note that
#                    negative numbers are allowed but may produce redraw
#                    artifacts under some circumstances, so use with caution.
# LeftIndent       - Multiplier used to work out left hand indent of text for
#                    list items etc., in millipoints.

# Fetch controls
# ==============
#
# MaxImages        - Maximum number of images that may be simultaneously fetched.
#                    Must be between 1 and 255, though values over about 25 are
#                    more likely to degrade performance than improve it.
# SupportPJPEG     - 'os' for OS JPEG support only, so no PJPEGs. Still, saves
#                    memory. 'both' to use the OS for JPEGs it can handle, else
#                    use internal routines - you get PJPEGs and save memory for
#                    the majority of JPEGs. For speed, if there is lots of free
#                    memory, use 'interal' - this uses internal routines only, so
#                    there's no 'direct from JPEG' plotting going on but you do
#                    get fast plotting and good dithering of all JPEGs.
# SupportFrames    - If 'yes', frames support is enabled, else 'no' - frames
#                    will not be fetched, and no alternative other than that
#                    already present in the HTML will be presented.
# SupportObject    - If 'yes', OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET will be handled,
#                    else if 'no' they will be ignored (so any alternative
#                    HTML in an OBJECT tag, say, will always be shown).
# SupportJS        - Support JavaScript (in JavaScript capable builds only).
# PlugInControl    - Controls when Plug-Ins are started, relative to page
#                    loading - 'never' for never, 'viewed' for when the bit of
#                    page in which a Plug-In lies is viewed (i.e. redrawn for
#                    the first time), or 'asap' to start as soon as the HTML
#                    defining the Plug-In has been fetched.
# ClientPull       - If client pull (automatic fetching/refetching of pages)
#                    causes problems - e.g. you didn't have time to read the
#                    page you were on before something else loaded - then
#                    this can be used to turn off client pull. It is
#                    enabled if 'yes', disabled if 'no'.
# SeeFetches       - Controls whether or not a 'small fetch' window is shown
#                    for Plug-in data fetching. This lets you abørt data
#                    fetching if you want to, but can clutter up the screen
#                    with fetch windows. Set to 'yes' to show them, else 'no'.

MaxImages:2
SupportPJPEG:both
SupportFrames:yes
SupportObject:yes
SupportJS:no
PlugInControl:viewed
ClientPull:yes
SeeFetches:no

# Image garbage collection
# ========================
#
# CollectAfter     - If 'yes', garbage collection occurs after a new page
#                    fetch is completed (free memory etc. permitting). This may
#                    mean higher transient memory requirements of course. If
#                    'no', garbage collection occurs the moment a page is
#                    cleared ready for a new one to fetch. This will affect how
#                    high you might want to set UnusedImageLimit.
# FreeRAMLimit     - If free memory falls below this amount when a new image is
#                    to be created, the garbage collection system is run to try
#                    and get more RAM. The amount is specified in bytes.
#                    Only as many images as need to be deleted to maintain the
#                    required free memory, are deleted. So, use 0 for unlimited
#                    (UnusedImageLimit becomes the only constraint).
# UnusedImageLimit - If the number of images a browser is holding ready for
#                    garbage collection exceeds the value given here, get rid
#                    of an unused image - so this number of unused images will
#                    be reached and thereafter maintained, since for each image
#                    created, one pending garbage collection is removed. Use
#                    zero to effectively disable image garbage collection;
#                    images from a current page are discard the moment that
#                    browser window goes to a new location. Use -1 for
#                    unlimited (FreeRAMLimit becomes the only constraint).

CollectAfter:no
FreeRAMLimit:2097512
UnusedImageLimit:10

# Hotlist controls
# ================
#
# HotlistPath      - Hotlist default load path.
# HotlistSave      - Hotlist default save path.
#
# SaveHotlist      - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the hotlist is
#                    saved each time a URL is added. For 'once', the hotlist is
#                    only saved on browser shutdown (if it crashes, new additions
#                    would be lost; but there's less in-session disc accessing).
#                    If 'never', the hotlist is never saved. Useful for hotlists

# Global and local histories
# ==========================
#
# HistoryPath      - Global history default load path.
# HistorySave      - Global history default save path.
# ImageHistoryPath - Same as HistoryPath, for the image history (the small
#                    history that remembers how large images are, so if they
#                    appear in HTML without any specified size the browser
#                    knows what size to pick straight away).
# ImageHistorySave - As above, but for saving the image history.
#
# MaxSize          - Maximum history size, in K. 0 for no limit.
# ImageMaxSize     - Same as above, for the image history.
# ExpiryAge        - Maximum age of a history entry, in seconds. 0 for no limit.
# ImageExpiryAge   - Save as above, for the image history.
#
# ShowURLs         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the History menu will always only
#                    contain URLs. Otherwise it will hold page titles (where
#                    available).
# SaveHistory      - 'always', 'once' or 'never'. For 'always', the global
#                    history is saved every time a new URL is added. For 'once',
#                    it is only saved on browser exit (so new additions would
#                    be lost if the browser crashed). For 'never', the history
#                    is never saved to disc.
# SaveImageHistory - Same as above, for the image history.

# Printing controls
# =================
#
# PrintCopies      - Default number of copies to print. Must be at least 1!
# PrintStart       - 'start' to print from the start of the web page, 'visible'
#                    to print from the top of the region visible in the browser
#                    window.
# PrintEnd         - 'end' to print to the end of the web page, 'visible' to
#                    print to the bottom of the region visible in the browser
#                    window, else a number greater than 0 for the number of pages
#                    to fill up after starting printing at the given start point.
# PrintReform      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will be reformatted to fit
#                    the paper size (else it is printed at a width determined by
#                    the browser window, which may mean it overflows the right
#                    hand edge of the paper or does not use the full page width).
#                    Reformatting can take quite a long time, hence this is
#                    optional. When using 'visible' for PrintStart or PrintEnd,
#                    this option is ignored and reformatting does not take place,
#                    as reformatting would change the visible region, if it was
#                    done in the window rather than internally for the printer.
# PrintOrient      - 'upright' or 'sideways', which pretty much says it all.
# PrintBack        - 'none' to print no backgrounds at all (plain or images),
#                    'tables' to print backgrounds in tables (plain only at
#                    present), or 'always' to print all backgrounds (plain in
#                    tables, images in the main page if the browser view
#                    options at the time are set to show background images).
# PrintBlack       - When printing, text in certain places may be plotted in
#                    black. To have all text in black, use 'all', or to have
#                    all text appearing in the colours as seen on the actual
#                    web page, use 'none'. Finally, you can specify that black
#                    text should be used for any part of the page where no
#                    background will be printed - for this, use 'bg'.
# PrintPlain       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then as soon as a print dialogue is
#                    opened for a browser any background images will be
#                    forcibly turned off (until the dialogue is closed).

# Toolbar controls
# ================
#
# URLbar           - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have URL
#                    bars present.
# ButtonBar        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have button
#                    bars present.
# StatusBar        - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have status
#                    bars present.
# MoveGadgets      - 'never', 'at end', or 'during' - gadgets in toolbars are
#                    never moved to fit inside the browser window, only moved at
#                    the end of a resize operation, or moved during a resize
#                    operation, respectively.

URLbar:yes
ButtonBar:yes
StatusBar:yes
MoveGadgets:during

# Window controls
# ===============
#
# Width            - Default browser window width, in OS units.
# Height           - Default browser window height, in OS units.
# OverrideX        - The X position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
# OverrideY        - The Y position to open the window at, or 0 for centred.
#
# SolidResize      - 'yes', 'no' or 'always'. If 'yes' frame border resizes will
#                    be solid, unless the CMOS RAM window solid resize bit is
#                    clear. If 'no', frame border resizes will never be solid
#                    (a dashed outline shows what the window sizes are), or
#                    if 'always', the drag is always solid, regardless of CMOS
#                    RAM settings.
#
# FullScreen       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the window will open full screen,
#                    else it will open at the default page size.
# HScroll          - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a horizontal scroll bar will be
#                    visible when Full Screen. Can also have 'auto', to
#                    add or remove scroll bars automatically, if the Wimp
#                    variant the browser runs on supports this. If the
#                    Wimp doesn't, this will work the same as 'yes'.
# VScroll          - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a vertical scroll bar will be
#                    visible when Full Screen. As for HScroll, can also
#                    have 'auto' with the right Wimp.
#
# NoScrollBars     - An option for frames; if 'yes', frames will have no
#                    scrollbars. You can either then use DragToScroll to move
#                    the page, or if you prefer, some 3rd party alternative.
#                    To have normal scrollbar behaviour (i.e. do whatever the
#                    HTML says), set to 'no'.
# DragToScroll     - If 'yes', an 'inactive' bit of page may be used to scroll
#                    a page view. Otherwise, this is not allowed.
# ShowMayScroll    - If 'NoScrollBars' is set to 'yes', display an indicator
#                    in a frame when part of it is obscured (i.e. show that
#                    it may scroll).
#
# ToggleOnYOnly    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' then a browser window's Toggle
#                    Size icon will only open the window to maximum size
#                    vertically. Otherwise it opens full width as well as
#                    full height. At any time, holding down Ctrl when clicking
#                    on the icon gives you the reverse behaviour.

# Reformatter controls
# ====================
#
# RefoWait         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the browser will wait for a time
#                    determined by 'RefoTime' (see below) before doing a page
#                    reformat - can be useful if frequent reformats when unsized
#                    images come in (for example) are proving annoying.
# RefoKeep         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the browser will attempt to keep
#                    the line displayed at the top of the visible portion of the
#                    page at the top, when the page reformats. Otherwise, the
#                    scroll position is not worried about when reformatting (so
#                    typically, the page scroll position jumps to the top).
#                    Note that the page may still jump briefly to the top anyway
#                    (see RefoHold below) and if the line at the top is in the
#                    middle of a paragraph of text, the reformatter may well
#                    track back a little and display the whole thing.
# RefoHold         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'no' the reformatter will attempt to
#                    match the y extent of the window to the last line in the
#                    page, which is normally desirable. When RefoKeep is set to
#                    'yes', though, this often means that the scroll position of
#                    the page will jump briefly to the top whilst the page is
#                    reformatted, until the line that the reformatter is trying
#                    to re-display is reached; the scroll position then jumps
#                    down to it. This flicker can be annoying. Setting RefoHold
#                    to 'yes' will stop the extent shrinking when the page is
#                    reformatted, but this can leave the scroll position down
#                    in the middle of nowhere whilst the reformatter deals
#                    with lines higher up.
# RefoTime         - If RefoWait is 'yes', the time in centiseconds between
#                    queued reformats (urgent reformats may force this earlier
#                    though - e.g. document fetch completed).

# Input device controls
# =====================
#
# FixedPtr         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the pointer will change shape as it
#                    moves over certain objects on the page (e.g. a link).
#                    Otherwise it stays the standard pointer shape, over the page.
# HighlightLks     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                    be highlighted as the pointer moves over them.
# KeyboardCtl      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                    be selectable from the keyboard.

# Multiuser environments and proxying
# ===================================
#
# Clone            - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' say we're Netscape(R) Navigator(TM)
#                    compatible.
# SendReferer      - 'never', 'always' or 'when http' - to send a Referer: header
#                    telling the remote server what page you just came from
#                    for page and image fetches. This is done for all protocols
#                    all the time with 'always', never sent with 'never' or only
#                    done for HTTP transfers if you choose 'when http'.
#
# UseProxy         - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' proxying will be used for HTTP
#                    fetches, so the value of the next two items is important.
#
# ProxyAddress     - The full base URL of the proxy server to use for HTTP
#                    fetching, including the protocol to use (http, ftp, etc.).
#
# UseProxyftp      - To proxy other protocols, add lines of the form
# UseProxygopher     "UseProxyxxx:yes" and "ProxyAddressxxx:xxx://this.host/",
# ProxyAddressftp    where "xxx" is the protocol (or scheme) name in lower case;
# etc.               such as 'ftp', 'gopher', or whatever. For example, to cache
#                    FTP fetches through a locally running copy of WebServe,
#                    add the lines "UseProxyftp:yes" and
#                    "ProxyAddressftp:http://127.0.0.1/" (yes, that should say
#                    'http' in as part of the proxy name, since WebServe only
#                    listens on that particular port - the address you should
#                    give will depend on the proxies you intend to use).
#
#                    To exclude specific hosts or domains from *any* proxying
#                    regardless of the protocol being used, add a line
#                    "ProxyExclusions:". This is followed by a comma separated
#                    list of domains or hosts - if the item starts with a full
#                    stop, it is considered a domain, else a host. For example,
#                    "ProxyExclusions:www.acorn.com,.ac.uk,www,.acorn.co.uk"
#                    would prevent cacheing for any URLs going to:
#
#                    * the host 'www.acorn.com' - e.g.
#                      'http://www.acorn.com/browser';
#                    * any host in the '.ac.uk' domain, for example
#                      'ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/';
#                    * any host called just "www", such as in
#                      'http://www/my_site/index.html';
#                    * and finally, any host in the domain '.acorn.co.uk', e.g.
#                      'http://www.acorn.co.uk/', 'ftp://ftp.acorn.co.uk/'.
#
# StartProxy       - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the proxy server (see Messages
#                    file) will be started if not already running. This is
#                    usually WebServe, and is usually used to provide local
#                    browser cacheing services.
#
# URIUsage         - Control usage of the URI handler, if present. Values are
#                    'never' (never use it), 'requests only' (process URI
#                    requests from the handler only, never send requests),
#                    'unknowns only' (broadcast unknown URI types, never handle
#                    requests), 'unknowns and requests' (broadcast unknown URI
#                    types and handle requests), or 'everything' (broadcast all
#                    URIs whether they can be dealt with in the core or not -
#                    and so always give a chance for other applications to step
#                    in at that point - and therefore, clearly, deal with any
#                    requests).
# Cookies          - Handling of cookies. Takes values 'reject', 'prompt' or
#                    'accept' to automatically reject all cookies, ask about
#                    each one, or automatically accept all cookies.

@Tweaks to export rules in Makefile - ResJ source for JavaScript builds,
all of User dir exported, resources rule exports About as well as User.

Handles images with a width or height of 0 specified in the HTML.
Previously went for a default size placeholder and changes to image
sizes and/or redraw problems could occur before/after subsequent
reformatting (involved trivial changes to image_get_image_size and
image_redraw_area only).

Default parameter HRs now plot properly in rectangular pixel modes.

Choices code updated to cope with the minimum font size, JS support,
watchdog on/off and timeout, Navigator object option added generally
(act even *more* like Navigator), image GC after fetch, and image
GC unused image / free RAM constraints.

Code in JSnavigator.c updated to obey new "act more like Navigator"
option (see above). Currently declares itself as version 3.0.

Resources for all builds are up to date. All links in default hotlist
verified and corrected where necessary, with several new links added.

This is Release v2.07. Not tested very much, sorry; YMMV.

@Everyone else seems to be checking lots of stuff in lately, so I've
decided to join in. This is an intermediate check-in and so not all
resources etc. will be up to date. You should be able to make Phoenix
and a debug build out of it. As a reminder, to make a JavaScript build:

 * Build JSLib and NSPRLib. Recommend you leave -DUSEMEMLIB in there (as
   used by default) so you can watch it leak into a dynamic area... :-)
   If you do this, you'll need to build MemLib too, of course. If you
   do NOT use MemLib, *undefine JS_USING_MEMLIB in Main.c*!
 * Run !MkClean. This now strips dynamic dependencies from the MakeFile
   automatically, to save you having to do it yourself.
 * Run one of the TaskObey files with the "J" suffix, e.g. !DeskBrwsJ -
   this uses the same .o directory for object files and exports to the
   same position in the Targets directory as the non-JavaScript build,
   but it does produce a unique binary in 'abs' and symbols table in
   'syms'.
 * Sourcing an appropriate !Run (with increased WimpSlot value), !Boot
   and About resource is done automatically.
 * Some, but not all of the !xxxD (debug) TaskObey files will make
   JavaScript versions in passing - check the JSUFFIX value on the Make
   command line parameters in the file.

This'll only work on RISC OS 3.1 due to the use of MemLib.

Here's the change list:

Included MNG icons in sprites files; added Sprites23 for some builds.
Added in ANT URL file icon (b28) derived from URI file icon, because
the Save dialogue can need it.

No, you do *not* need to define the same keyboard shortcuts in each
frame since the ancestor keeps the input focus and we've basically
dropped non-nested Wimp support. Maintaining no less than 4 lists of
identical shortcuts was a pain. Some Res files now only have the
lists in the main browser window and button bar objects (these two
are both required still).

Ursula build Markers button arrangement changed from 1x3 horizontal to
2x2 tilted, as in Phoenix, by popular demand.

Couple of hotlist bugs fixed; dragging an item and deleteing it with
Ctrl+X didn't terminate the drag, and deleteting an item underneath a
menu opened for it didn't close the menu.

'SendReferer' option added to all Choices files, all set to 'always'.
Put just beneath 'Clone' as it refers to header items, though really,
both Clone and SendReferer should probably be in the "Fetch controls"
section rather than "Multiuser environments and proxying"! Front-end
control of this is available.

In image_export_original, save_save_source, save_transfer_source and
save_save_object, flex_set_budge(0) was called to lock the heap but the
return value wasn't stored. flex_set_budge(1) was then used to unlock
the heap. All calls now remember and restore the old value, which is
both safer in case one calls another and allows the flex_set_budge
call in Main.c to have an application-wide meaning, as intended.

Some restructuring to the data load and RAM transfer sections of
Protocols.c; remote hotlist builds wouldn't allow files to be loaded
to browser windows before, and can now drop URL, URI or text files to
the Open URL dialogue.

New option "MinimumFontSize", lets the 'size' attribute of the 'font'
element be overridden. Default value is 1, to allow the full range of
values for the attribute. Setting to 7, for example, would give font
size 7 text at all times. Another new option, "ToggleOnXOnly", to
make Toggle Size only extend the window vertically (with Ctrl then
being used to toggle to genuine full size, rather than vice versa).
All Choices files updated to hold both of these options; only the
first has front-end control available (see debug build Res file).

JavaScript Document object exists; frames array etc. working. Can now
just about use "http://www.acorn.com/~ahodgkin/jschain/" but it does
abort after a bit - problems with frames again, I suspect. Is is pretty
slow, too. Can now press Escape to terminate a script.

Main.c erroneously referred to Controls file entry "StopWebServe" as
"StopWebProxy". Fixed.

Keyboard shortcuts to raise SaveFile are now possible in a general sense;
the code before was in the ToBeShown handler and just checked for a parent
component of -1. It then assumed "save frame HTML source". Now there's the
savefile_raise_from_shortcut function, which together with the seven new
event codes in SaveFile.h allows saving of HTML source and frame location,
export of links, images, backgrounds and the page as text or draw, to all
be invoked by keyboard shortcuts. Some Res files have some of these defined.

In reformat_check_height, the first check to see if setpara should be set
references a field in tpLast without checking if it is NULL. Whilst the
'line > 0' check should mean that tpLast wasn't NULL anyway, a direct
call to the function from outside of the reformatter might have tripped
up on this - the check for tpLast != NULL is now made.

Adjust-click on close icon in window showing file: URL attempts to open
the parent Filer window.

Reformatter used to try and find a selectable token if keyboard control
was enabled in a really stupid place - could make reformatting become
very slow if no selectables were present, especially if the page had a
few tables on it. Preprocessor now does this (since it goes through all
of the tokens anyway), the reformatter just doing a last check to ensure
no frames have obscured the selectable and if so, it tries to move it.
Done in the reformatter as generating a line array implies the data really
is visible.

Ctrl+Tab URL completion now builds a full list of matches from the hotlist
and history and can cycle through them (Ctrl+Shift+Tab stepping backwards).

Will give a real error rather than just "Data Abort" if it goes wrong
now. Someone somewhere is setting bit 30 of the error which confused
the replacement signal handler. Flag bits are now masked off (as they
should've been to start with).

@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.

@By request, an intermediate 2.06 check-in. This is not a "proper" release
and will need some Makefile fiddling etc. to swap between JavaScript and
standard builds and so-forth. The Resources files are not all up to date;
only Phoenix and the testbed Browse are more or less current. Right now,
JavaScript doesn't work, SO COMPILE IT OUT. But to make a JavaScript build
for a larf -

 * Build JSLib and NSPRLib. Recommend you leave -DUSEMEMLIB in there (as
   used by default) so you can watch it leak into a dynamic area... :-)
   If you do this, you'll need to build MemLib too, of course. If you
   do NOT use MemLib, *undefine JS_USING_MEMLIB in Main.c*!
 * Run !MkClean
 * Add -DJAVASCRIPT to DFLAGS in MakeFile
 * Strip dynamic dependencies from MakeFile
 * Rebuild Phoenix or the Desktop build of Browse
 * In the exported copy, increase the !Run file WimpSlot value; either
   use the appropriate symbols table in 'syms' or use about 960K for
   non-debug, 4600K for debug builds.
 * If the exported copy has an About resource, edit the HTML file inside
   and uncomment the line about JavaScript.
 * Reverse most of the above to rebuild a non-JavaScript copy! :-O

I hope to have much of the above automated soon (either by a new target,
or preferably hackery with the MakeFile).

Here's the change list:

References to 'Phoenix' removed from Ursula build Res file Choices dialogue
help text (only a couple of them). Cookie value display made taller in the
Cookie Query dialogue (prompt field shrunk to accommodate this).

Yikes - ever since markers, "reformat page to fit paper" hasn't done
anything when printing; the reformatter reset the HTML page limits to
the window size at startup! Fixed. Using markers, you can now also reformat
from the top of the visible area and still reformat to fit the paper; the
print dialogue used to grey out the reformat option in this case. It still
does this when printing to the bottom of the visible area, though.

You can drag text files to form writables (single and multiple line,
but NOT password items (deliberately; it's trivial to add this but I
think it'd be a bad idea)). Normally, data is appended up to the limit
specified by the field (unlimited for multiple line items). Holding
down Ctrl replaces the current value entirely (still, again, limited
by maximum field length). The caret is moved from wherever it currently
is and placed at the end of the added data. Note that you *cannot* insert
in the middle of text by placing the caret and dropping.

Things can get distinctly sluggish when you start dragging many Ks of
text file into a multi-line writable, so the keyboard buffer is cleared
for any input code < 32, equal to 127 (backspace - this one is a little
less clear cut, but I think it's probably worthwhile) and anything
> 255. This way, when typing, you don't lose characters; but when moving
around, you don't find the cursor "running away" from you.

Multi-line writables (text areas) would redraw a vertical column taller,
or horizontal column wider than the element covers itself should the
user scroll enough in any one direction (e.g. Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down to
go to the top or end of the area). The code working out how much of
the area to redraw by the number of lines or columns moved didn't ensure
it kept within the area. Because an update rather than force redraw is
done, with background blending turned on text around the area would
"thicken". Now fixed.

Form menu entries have (at long last) a space appended to each one, so
the Wimp doesn't get confused and think something is a keyboard shortcut
when someone expresses "Formula 1" as (say) "F1"... Now fill in the menu
width entry from having read the actual VDU character width and spacing,
not that anyone uses the original RO 3.1 Wimp with Browse any more! (The
code existed elsewhere anyway, so it was trivial to add).

Ctrl+U in a multi-line writable clears the contents of the line the caret
is on, but doesn't delete the line itself. Ctrl+J now does this.

DDFLAGS doesn't set ALIAS_URLS - Customer build has this now.

Tiled images were being plotted in the wrong place in some modes (a '+4'
in the starting y coordinate calculations in the three filler / tile
functions should have been '+wimpt_dy()').

MessageTrans lookup buffer extended from 256 to 320 bytes (Limits_Message
in Limits.h), mostly to support Messages files alterations for the About
page.

Spelling error in URI handler menu for Desktop (also known as Ursula,
though this is now something of a misnomer) build corrected. There was
a missing 'l' in 'handler'). StartProxy setting in Choices was 'no' and
is now 'yes'.

Downloading files of sizes over about 20Mb would cause an overflow in
the % calculating code ("(fetched * 100) / file_size" as opposed to
"100 * (fetched / file_size)" with (float) and (int) casts as required.
Percentages now shown to 1dp; Mb displays to 2dp where the file size is
not known.

Download speed is now indicated in Small Fetch windows. Increased the
delay between progress indicator updates as part of this, and modified
Res files to cope (byte counter needs to be enlarged quite a lot). It
isn't shown in normal browser windows because the enlarged byte counter
looks daft in that context (normally, there's never enough information
to fill even half of it).

Adjust-click on an unlinked part of a client side image map could give an
invalid object ID error from accidentally using the return value of a
previous Toolbox call instead of the return result of a call to a fetcher
routine - because given it had a NULL pointer for the URL, there was no
such call made. Corrected in windows_create_browser() and
handle_link_clicks() won't try to do this in the first place anymore.
fetchpage_fetch_targetted() will also warn of such NULL pointers in
TRACE builds.

Submitting a GET form back to the same URL would lead to the query
string getting appended to the fetch URL over and over. form_build_data
now checks to see if there's already a query string in the submission
URL for GET methods and if so, strips it. fetchpage_new_add will do a
similar thing in the case of the additional data starting with '?'.

When following a link, if RefoKeep was 'yes', the page could sometimes
jump to a pre-stored scroll position; it was down to the resize routines
remembering it, but if windows_check_reformat() or windows_remember_size()
didn't actually do a reformat the position was not forgotten. It is now,
so this jumping should no longer occur.

Single character leafnames (e.g. "a.class") used to be reported just as
"Index" in a save dialogue for the object. Fixed.

<P> elements could fail to work as expected in some circumstances. For
example, there would be no gap above '<p> <b>...' - the <b> text doesn't
have the <p> attached, the tag before it does. However, the white space
on this tag gets stripped so it ends up with a NULL text field. This
means that paragraph space is allocated but the text height for the line
thus far is zero. This has been fixed through special case code in
reformat_check_height.

browser_base_url() function added, which through browser_base_callback
can supply a base URL for the current document.

In-page references (URLs with '#something' in them) would fail if the
page contained a BASE tag which pointed elsewhere (that is, the page
would be fetched from its base URL and references would work thereafter;
not very useful for developing sites on your local hard drive). Fixed.
Fixed also the problem where in-page references would fail once after
a forced reload.

Several ultra-stupid bugs in image cross referencing code within
image_update_image fixed:

 - No longer redraws *every* page with the same background when
   *any* of those backgrounds are updated; just if the page with
   the actual image data attached is updated. Doh!

 - Similarly, no longer updates every copy of an image when asked
   to update any of them, only when the one holding the actual image
   data is updated.

 - In the above cases, image array a scanning is avoided wherever
   possible now, whereas it used to happen for any update.

Animated masked GIFs will no longer flicker briefly when they are first
viewed on a page.

Hacky but useful optimisation in Images.c. Local compilation option
'FAST_TOKEN_REFERENCE' controls whether or not the flags word of each
HStream associated with an image_info struct is used in part to store
the image's array index. If so, there's no array scanning to do - this
signficantly speeds up cross referenced image handling. It's still
rather undertested "but it seems to work". The number of bits used for
the array index is controlled by FAST_TOKEN_REFERENCE_SHIFT, and is
currently 20, giving around a 1 million image limit on the browser
and leaving 12 bits for genuine flags (only 3 currently used).

If an error occurred when Message_PlugIn_Opening was received, Browse
would exit early with the message - before it removed the plug-in from
the queue, thus stopping other launches. The error is now reported and
then the item is still removed, preventing this problem.

The BASEHREF entry in the parameters file used for plug-in launching
will now give the contents of any BASE tag in the document before
looking at the display URL, then the fetch URL.

When a new page is visited or a browser window closed, any in progress
fetches for plug-ins are abandoned. They weren't before, which caused
all sorts of problems later on. In addition, any pending plug-in items
in the queue may not have been correctly flushed (the first item may
have been left behind), which can cause mis-firing of the plug-in
engine as it picks up outdated queue items and attemps to launch them.
This has also been fixed.

Fixed problem with asynchronous delivery and reception of the Stream_New
plug-in protocol messages, which previously would be incorrectly handled -
Browse assumed that, as with plug-in launch, only one fetch would be running
at a time (or the message passing between plug-in and fetch window would
occur synchronously). This is not the case, and a variety of problems could
be seen if the system broke down. The most obvious symptom is in Scrap,
where Browse used to leave behind "BTFxxxxx" files on quit.

Intermittent "Invalid object ID" errors cured; the Find dialogue box
handler wasn't clearing its remembered ID, and since Find is a shared
object, that object could get deleted without the Find code
realising.

Corrected mis-spelling of "Parameters" n comment block at top of
about_copy_info_file(), which fouled up the documentation auto-generation.

BuildSHelp will recognise functions indented by 2 spaces, assume they're
indented because of a wrapping #ifdef, and put 'Conditionally compiled.'
under the name of any such functions. It no longer outputs broken manuals
if no functions are found in a source file. More robust to odd input due
to extra EOF checking.

New utility BuildHTML, to generate HTML pages in the same manner as
BuildSHelp, created from BuildSHelp. This was done to support Ferrotec
who'd like StrongHelp-like documentation but don't want to be tied to
Acorn machines (and haven't got any at the time of writing anyway!).
HTML was agreed as a good, easy format to go for.

Have begun to implement JavaScript support. Updated !Boot and !Run[D]
files to define File$Type_F81 and Alias$@@RunType_F81 (0xf81 is a
JavaScript script file, 'JSScript', MIME type application/x-javascript,
common filename extension '.js'.). !Sprites[22] files have the relevant
file icons added. Messages files extended with various tokens for
miscellaneous error messages, error box buttons etc. Created a Browse
About: page section based on the JavaScript filetype - we at last
credit the use of the JPEG group software, LibPNG, etc.

@All !Run[D], Choices, Messages, Controls and Res files are up to date.

RefoKeep and RefoHold options added to, respectively, try and maintain
the line at the top of the visible area when reformatting, and not shrink
the vertical extent at the start of a reformat to try and avoid flicker
to the top of the page and back down again when RefoKeep is on. Choices
front-end implemented, which also allows RefoWait and RefoTime to be set.
Unfortunately for various reasons this doesn't help the page jumping when
unsized images come in (but RefoHold can improve matters...) - roll on
the image history.

DragToScroll and NoScrollBars options added for frames; included new
pointer type, Mouse_Shape_DTS, so relevant Controls file entries done
and Sprites[22] files updated as required. Noticed some builds have
a low-res ptr_link with a mask - mask removed.

Named anchor following fixed up somewhat - anchors near the bottom of
the page shouldn't be displayed, and then pulled down when the fetcher
releases null polls and ensures the y extent is correct (this through
implementing the min_height field in the browser_data structure).

RefoHang was never implemented and there seems little point to it now,
so the entry for it has been removed from the global choices structure
and all Choices files.

Markers menus should work properly now (in last check-in they would not
update correctly if Adjust was used on the entries).

URI handler usage now a lot more sensible, with configuration of how the
browser uses the module from both a Utils menu submenu (sic) and the
Choices dialogue.

Slightly dodgy 'hang around waiting for user input' stuff for the Cookies
dialogue box: All fetches are suspended; the fetcher remembers some info
about its state at the time the cookie came in, and restores it later; it
will only do this for one fetch at a time. It's necessary to single-thread
the fetcher at this point anyway, since other fetches may have a
dependency on the cookie that is hanging in mid-air at that point. As part
of this, some of the fetcher code has been split out into separate
functions (to try and 'black box' the code a bit). Anyway, Cookie Query
dialogue box now implemented with appropriate Choices file entry and
UI work in the Choices dialogue box.

Phoenix build Choices rearranged. Can now choose when the image history
is saved from the front end. Added also MSIE 4-style table option menu
for JPEG support (OS only, OS if it can handle it, internal only).

Should be a bit faster at loading the history - though 95% of the time
is spent in SWI URL_ParseURL. URL descriptions are stored more
efficiently as part of this - one malloc block instead of several
small blocks. The minimum block size for malloc blocks typically leads
to a significantly smaller startup wimpslot depending on the visit
history size.

Nasty bug in image system fixed. If an image size came in and a reformat
was to take place, the line the image lies in is found and the reformat
progresses from there. Unforunately, this didn't check to see if the
token can't be found in the line list, so it'd reformat from the top
of the page...! This would happen if, for example, an image halfway down
the page came in whilst a reformat for an image higher up had just begun.

In Choices.c, made choices_set_timetype_field, choices_set_uri_field,
choices_set_plugin_field, choices_set_cookie_field, and
choices_set_jpeg_field static (so they're not declared in Choices.h now).

Two memory leaks plugged in URL comparison routines in URLutils.c
(calling free() url_description instead of urlutils_free_descripton()).

Client pull reload handler was setting the reload flag if reloading
the same page, but forgetting to turn on reload_lock so
fetchpage_postprocessed was clearing the reload state... Similarly,
Ctrl+Shift+SELECT-Click on a link when the Controls file 'UseSmall'
entry is 'no' would not have reloaded as it should. Both fixed.

Frames shouldn't be so keen on acquiring horizontal scroll bars and never
letting them go when their width is decreased now. Frames set up for
'scrolling="yes"' will not start with no scroll bars and then gain them
shortly afterwards, causing flicker and two reformats - they'll start
with, and continue to hold, both scroll bars.

Pointer shouldn't flicker when over a frame border whilst other fetches
are progressing now.

@Programming warehouse link removed from all hotlists - the page has gone.

Some compile-time hacks in place to use MemLib, a dynamic area based
malloc replacement which shrinks its heap when possible. All builds
have these switched off at the moment. Seemed to work with just Browse,
though there would be problems with message blocks stored in dynamic
areas because of the Wimp's '&3800000' check - however, it failed when
HTMLLib was made to use it, too. Don't know why yet.

ItemInfo.[c/h] source added, with Res file additions for testbed Browse
and Phoenix.

Small fetch windows now work properly regardless of toolbar settings
in the Choices.

Reload now reloads all images too, rather than only reloading them for
as long as the main page was being fetched.

Added a simple 'Find' facility.

Realised that event handlers in eventlib are called in reverse order
of registration, so the miscellaneous event handler is now registered
first rather than last.

Multiuser code added (most only active if SINGLE_USER is undefined). As
part of this, hotlist code now knows about read-only items (done for the
Customer-style 'Resources' file, but works generally anyway).
handle_add_hotlist doesn't try to save the hotlist itself anymore (the
hotlist_add function does all that through hotlist_modified anyway).

Customer build Choices and Controls updated slightly (e.g. ClaimHelp
off, hotlist to save on quit only).

Customer build now uses Phoenix-style buttons. Sprites files which
worked at the time (but will probably be out of date now) and included
most of the original Customer-style sprites are in
'Utils.Icons.Customer'.

Choices, Messages and Res files for all builds now stripped down to only
single user items or single plus multiuser for Customer build and testbed
build. Before, all contained a few multiuser bits in at least the Choices
file if not more.

Grammatical error ("Fetching frames contents" (sic.)) corrected in
default message, Toolbars.c, and all of the Messages files.

Customer build brought back to a servicable level (including
implementation of the Find dialogue box with animation and fixing
up authorisation and 'Stop' state in the tristate). Quite a few
missing #ifndef REMOTE_HOTLIST bits from hotlist code added...

Customer build will not use <Choices$Write> or Boot:Choices for any
file finding now. UseProxy defaults to 'yes', MaxImages to 2. Res
file includes Proxy Address setting (save_save_choices() now writes
the ProxyAddress line).

@Check for WindowManager 3.97 and ensure Unicode$Path is set in all
!Run[D] files, don't set the Alias$@@PrintType_FF4 variable, and updated
Customer build ROM obey file variants. Various other changes to
the Run files for new module versions, updated paths to support
new positions of choices, hotlist and histories (see later), etc.

!Sprites[22] files hold small !app icons for some variants, and
an ic_browse sprite. Some variants now have a Sprites and Sprites22
file instead of just Sprites, with the former containing various
mode 12 or 15 specific sprites.

Text files dragged to the URL writable are treated as ANT URL files. This
relies on URLBarWrit (Toolbars.h) being a unique ID, which it should be,
but beware of the Hotlist and Choices numberspaces...

INPUT TYPE=BUTTON supported. Form items without a FORM tag are now shown
(as MSIE 4, but not NN 4).

'*', '-', '@@', '_' and '.' are not escaped when submitting forms now. The
Web interface to the IMDb now works.

INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN items will not affect the line height anymore - so
http://www.hotmail.com/ now has correctly aligned writable icons, for
example. Similarly, TAG_FORM and TAG_FORM_END items could push up
line height and don't anymore.

HRs with a specified pixel width will now influence the size of a table
cell (they didn't before).

BRs now checked by tagno field when the browser needs to know something
was an actual BR tag rather than just a line break signal, and by the
style bit entry when only the indication of a line break is required.

Table widths of 0 or 0% are ignored.

Trace.c updated to report height and background fields in a table_stream.

fm_putsl() writes a terminator into the string; the Forms.c routines were
calling this for displaying INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD fields using the FE_PassCode
literal string (a line of stars). This write into a read only data area
would make the debugger fault the access. A local char array is now used
instead, to get round this (note the use of var[]=literal rather than
var[sizeof(literal)]; strcpy(var, literal) due to some weird compiler bug
that copies the wrong thing into 'var' under some (undefined...)
circumstances).

Text areas don't scroll back to the top line when clicked in anymore;
single line writables don't scroll back to the left either. When
reentering a text area from 'above', the caret appears at the top line
rather than 'somewhere further down'...

ARROWS_MOVE_OUT compile time option at the top of Forms.c defines whether
you must press Tab/Shift+Tab to move between writable fields in forms or
if up/down will drop out of them, though if keyboard control is on this
is enforced (or you get trapped inside the form!).

urlutils_filetype_from_url now uses MimeMap module.

If fetcher is told a page is text, it'll check for a filename extension and
may choose to use this instead (e.g. it may find it's HTML instead). This
is to try and get around duff servers... (e.g. http://www.batalarms.co.uk/).

Save dialogues shouldn't flicker when options that don't change the
filetype are selected (before, the draggable sprite was always reset for
each selection). Noticed the erroneous setting of a static variable in
SaveFile.c by a call to this by SaveObject.c, and so added a flag to
savefile_set_filetype to deal with this - would have been possible to get
the wrong filetype sent to applications or at best the wrong filetype
sprite in the dialogue without that.

The caret shouldn't jump out of a form back to the URL writable if the page
reformats now.

Table background colours now supported (as in the colour you see in the
border space if the cellspacing is large enough; this is as in MSIE, not
as in Navigator). Drawfile output routines updated accordingly.

Corrected erroneous use of wimpt_dx() / wimpt_dy() in a couple of places
in Images.c, which meant that (say) 1x1 images didn't work correctly in
medium resolution display modes.

Now have support for save as text (component ID and event 0x12) and save
as Draw (component ID and event 0x13) buttons. Dubious conditions for
greying and ungreying the print, save source and view source buttons and
menu options sorted out as part of implementing the same for the two new
buttons; added greying out of their associated menu items in passing.

Turned kerning on in draw file objects (does mean a rather heinous
increase in file size, but this is the only way to ensure the draw file
matches the visible page).

Comments before functions in SaveDraw.c are now complete and up to date.

Image and visit histories now generate a crude hash number to speed up
searching for items. It does give a speed increase, though it's a
disappointingly small one.

Issue of left/right margins and cellpaddings sorted out. Now have
redraw_left/right_margin for finding out the basic gap you must leave.
redraw_left/right_gap then gives any extra indentation for LI, BLOCKQUOTE
or whatever. The last two can be subtracted from the display width to
get an available page width for any section of text. Note that
redraw_left_gap replaces redraw_margin. The redraw_start_x function
uses the above to work out where a line's left hand edge should be,
taking account of left/right/centre alignment. HRs have been fixed now
(they were quite broken in v1.30, I think) based on this new model and
the behaviour of MSIE/NN 4.

Fixed width of cells with no contents - cell padding values wouldn't
have worked properly as the reformatter returns 0 rather than the left
hand margin size if given no stream.

Removed FM_Absolute flags for Font_Paint (spotted by DBrown) - sets bit
2, which is reserved...?

IMG width and height in % terms now works correctly; a % of available
width (after margins and indents) or height on the main page or for
a table cell, if the image lies in one. Because of the chicken-and-egg
problem with the latter, the cell must specify a width and/or height
for things to work properly. If this is not done, you'll usually end
up with a 1:1 scaled image (as in Navigator 4, rather than ending up
with no image or even no cell (!), as in MSIE 4).

HEIGHT attribute on a TABLE tag is supported, but only in a crude
fashion; the extra height (if there is any) is distributed over the
rows in a linear fashion. This is probably all you have to do in
practice, but I haven't checked. To maintain a notion of min/max
height as well as width would of course require a great deal more
work...

If using client pull to reload a page with a fragment ('...#name')
specified, then the reload wouldn't work on the same page; it'd just
jump to the fragment position. This won't happen if b->reloading is
set now (so works in conjunction with client pull on the same page
forcing a non-cached fetch). Similarly, if POSTing to such a URL,
a fetch will proceed (both these fixes done originally for
http://jupiter.beseen.com/chat/rooms/g/1678/).

browser_inherit split to browser_inherit and browser_inherit_post_data;
the code for the latter didn't clear any post_data in the child before
copying from the parent either, and could cause flex errors (now fixed).

Res file for Ursula ('Desktop' Browse) build tweaked - bits in the
font choices dialogue renamed, and button bar rearranged to hold the
new Save As Draw button. Other builds have had Save As Draw and
Save As Text buttons added, or not, depending upon availability of
suitable sprites, required UI simplicity, etc.

Now have:

  Browse$ChoicesFile
  Browse$ControlsFile
  Browse$ChoicesSave
  Browse$ControlsSave

(the last two are new) for loading and saving of the Choices or Controls
files. If unset, <App$Dir>.Choices or <App$Dir>.Controls will be set.
E.g., you could set Browse$ChoicesFile to be:

  <App$Dir>.Choices,Choices:WWW.(app).Choices

for loading and

  <Choices$Write>.WWW.(app).Choices

for saving. (The browser never saves Controls at the moment, so the
relevant variable above isn't effectively implemented, but could be
in future). Similarly, to support asymetric loading/saving of the Hotlist,
there are HotlistSave, HistorySave and ImageHistorySave entries in Choices
to complement HotlistPath, HistoryPath and ImageHistoryPath (which are used
for loading). save_save_choices will create directories as needed to obtain
the given path (and has also been fixed in various areas that hadn't been
tested out until now; e.g. zero termination of the AppName$ChoicesFile
variable expansion...). !Run[D] files updated appropriately.

Table widthing code rewritten. Slower, but a lot better on the whole.
Still has some problems - still needs a final 'make sure nothing is
below minimum width' scan, which it should be possible to do without.
No time to fix this at present!

The reformatter will now 'glue together' an LI token followed by any
non-LI token; so a bullet point followed by an item should not be able to
have a line break inserted after the bullet because of very tight width
constraints (it could before - yuk...).

'about:' brings up a page about the browser and any Plug-Ins, as with
Navigator (for example).

URI files support titles, as per spec. version 8. Saving a current
location to the Hotlist will thus give a sensible title now (unless
you're in a frame, so there's no title to get...). Of course, v1.00
files without a title still work.

Note that NOBR is *not* supported in this build and this combined with
the new table widther may cause problems on some sites (e.g. Microsoft's
home page!).

@Fixed some glitches in the modified status bar code (e.g. status inference
wasn't working properly).

Shift+Toggle size always opened to not obscure the icon bar. If CMOS is
set to always show the icon bar, then Shift+Toggle size is meant to
reverse sense and open to absolute full size. It now does this.

!Run[D] files now require URL 0.22, HTTP 0.64, FTP 0.22, Gopher 0.08
and File 0.32.

Minor overhaul of 'Docs.Notes' (with 'Docs.User' similarly updated) to
include a few new bits and pieces.

Timeout values of 0 now mean 'forever'. Plug-in status messages now have
their own timeout setting. New Messages token 'Actv' for extra info when
a status message times out and the status line drops to 'Viewing' or
'Ready' when there is still a Busy state registered by the Plug-in.

Small Fetch windows don't become visible briefly for Plug-in fetches
when the fetch is complete (for SeeFetches:no, where these windows
should be hidden all the time).

WebServe may be controlled through the Browse front-end via.
Wimp_MAppControl reason code 4 (Wimp_MAppControl_Configure). Note the
renaming internally of 'WebServ' or 'WebServe' has been changed to
'Proxy' (with lower case equivalents where relevant); proxy name
and starting details come from the Messages file 'ProxyName' and
'ProxyComm' tokens. More in 'Docs.Notes'.

Res files updated for image history and PRE/TT font aspect ratio
choices. 'Don't expire' labels changed to 'Expire' (oops, didn't
notice the change in the development Browse's Res file when I
updated all of the others until now...).

When printing, Wimp_PlotIcon appears to ignore R4 and R5, plots
'somewhere' on the page, and tries to get the sprite from the global
pool. This latter part normally causes an error to be raised; though
on my machine I just get a corrupted error message. The Desktop font
gets lost at this point too. All have yet to be fixed; as an
interim work around, Wimp_PlotIcon objects are never drawn at all
if the global 'printing' flag is set.

@Implemented Message_PlugIn_ReshapeRequest, Message_PlugIn_Status and
Message_PlugIn_Busy. Plug-in code more robust when given invalid
browser instance handles by the plug-in.

Line spacing is now calculated on the basis of the normal style base serif
font, with all other fonts being forced into that line height. This does
mean that an unusually tall (say) sans serif font may get clipped. It
appears to be the only way to get around wildly different baseline
depths returned from the font metrics - you can't work out line spacing
based on each different font style; the line spacing will vary.

Table heighting (as opposed to widthing...) improved considerably; rowspan
can no longer cause very tall cells in odd places. Having trouble getting
rid of the single pixel breaks between vertically adjacent cells, though
I've not tried too hard. Widthing, though, seems fairly badly broken at
present... :-/

Set/clear of page_is_text flag made more robust (it looked as though there
was the potential for this to get stuck in a set state, though I've never
see the front-end behave in a manner which indicates this is the case).
The reformatter will now decrease leading if this flag is set (plain text
pages look daft with a line spacing that is OK for 'rich' text pages).
No reformatting is done if the page width changes by dragging on the
resize icon, though toggle size / full screen will still reformat even
if the contents are only text (browser needs to sort out various width
flags at this point).

Cut down on excessive redrawing when reformatting due to a change in
window dimensions is not done. If display_width hasn't changed, then no
redraw is needed. If this causes redraw problems, then whatever is
changing display_width needs investigating. It shouldn't be kludged
(basically) by forcing a redraw instead of a reformat.

TT/PRE/etc. text can now have a non-100% aspect ratio. 80-90% looks
best (ArcWeb, for example, uses 86%). New option 'TTAspect' in
the Choices files.

Debug builds link to a non-debug Unicode library now; stops stderr
being dumped to the bottom left of the screen if you've not redirected
it in the Run file.

RISC OS 3.1 seems to need more initial WimpSlot than later OS versions.
The 64 deep nested table set gives a 'No stack for trap handler' error
(which it really means in this case!) without 800K, even though 3.71
is happy with just 640K. So, the !Run file checks if Boot$OSVersion
is exactly 300, 310 or 311, and sets the WimpSlot accordingly.

!Run[D] files now require latest fetcher module versions (URL 0.21,
File 0.31, HTTP 0.58).

@Image history - sizes of images are remembered for future reference (if
the sizes aren't specified in the HTML, they can be looked for in the
image history instead to minimise reformatting requirements). Choices
file options ImageHistoryPath, ImageExpiryAge, ImageMaxSize and
SaveImageHistory added to support this (all have a direct analogy to
the global History items of the same name after removing 'Image').

Text area items are now the correct height for the number of rows
specified in the HTML, don't scroll a line too early, and have the
caret placed at the start of the text when moved into from above
or at the end when moved into from below (rather than always at
the end, which was behaviour inherited from single line writables,
where this is desirable). The top of the text area is aligned to
the top of any line of text on the same line, with the text area
dropping below the text, rather than the bottom of the area matching
the text baseline and extending upwards.

Filename extensions for download files are only stripped if an
attempt to convert to a RISC OS filetype through the Mime Mapper module
does not return an error or Data (0xffd) filetype. '.cgi' is a special
case which is always stripped.

Altered heading styles - all are bold, none are italic, H3 is as big
as H2 was, H2 is a little larger, and others scale down to H6 being
the size as normal text (but, as I say, bold).

Sorted out tables and forms. We can just look for tagno=TAG_FORM, and
get rid of the wobbly form_flag; also discarded the redundant
reprocess_table flag in fetch_preprocess_token. Two separate forms
in consecutive table cells (for example) which used to fail - they
were submitted as one single form - will now work correctly.

Fixed nasty bug in FontManage.c where font size 7 would intermittently
fail. The stupid font sizes that it could ask the Font Manager for may
be responsible for the occasional Font Manager crashes that have been
noticed. Array for font sizes was declared as [Limits_FontSizes], but
indices 1 to Limits_FontSizes are actually used - so needed a '+ 1'
in the declaration... :-/

Replaced the case insensitive string comparison functions in Utils.c
with more efficient versions by S.Brodie.

MAXLENGTH specifier in INPUT tags is now supported. If unspecified or
specifically zero, the browser overrides and allows any length.

@Following the last check-in - all build resources brought up to date.

Adjust-click on forwards/backwards buttons did not work in the intermediate
build, and now does.

Adjust-click on form submission buttons where the submit method is POST
will now work correctly, as the new view inherits the extradata block
of the old. Failure of this is signalled through
make_no_fetch_memory_error, code 16 (see updated Errors file in Docs).
Note the name change of extradata in this context; more details below.

The passing of forms POST data and extra headers for sending in an
HTTP request via. the URL module was all done through pointers into
flex blocks, and was therefore very unsafe. All relevant functions now
use pointers to pointers to the data.

To remove confusion on the umpteen uses of the word 'extradata', the field
in browser_data has been renamed to 'post_data'. The 'extradata' parameters
used within FetchPage.c were all disconnected from the extra header info /
form POST data stuff that extradata is usually associated with, and have
thus also been renamed, in this case to 'appnddata' (Append Data).

As well as X-NoProxy, the browser sends the 'proper' HTTP headers
Pragma:no-cache and Cache-Control:no-cache.

A redirection from a POST request was not handled correctly; despite
what HTTP specs say, you're supposed to use GET for the new URL. The
browser was, but when it chopped off the redundant header data in the
request didn't terminate it and left Content-Type in anyway...! Fixed.

Ctrl+Tab implemented - URL completion. Comes from the hotlist URLs,
hotlist titles, history hosts, paths, full URLs and lastly titles.
See code comments for more (history_find_match, hotlist_find_match).

TableSupport option added to Choices; it is read, can be set by the
front-end, but doesn't actually do anything else yet.

Reversed Choices' semantics on 'don't expire by...' for History. Added
'needs_redraw' flag to choices_get_contents so that, for example, if the
table border types change, browsers get redrawn.

@This is an intermediate check-in to allow work on Choices for the new
table options and History choices as detailed below. Res files are not
up to date except where indicated and there are several known bugs that
will be fixed before the 'final' v1.27 is created. Any work on resources
should only be done for the testbed !Browse.

Client side image maps implemented. There is code to draw highlighted
borders in CSIM.c, but this is not wired in yet; other than that,
the implementation is functionally complete. As part of this, centralised
the fetching of a targetted URL taking into account user request of a
new view and full screen mode, in fetchpage_fetch_targetted. The forms
library now uses this too, so form buttons respond to both adjust-clicks
and TARGET attributes.

Fixed APPLET handling where '.class' isn't present in the CODE attribute.

Paragraphs squashed at the top of cells/pages - browser would insert white
space before.

Now append a ' ' to the end of History menu items to prevent the Wimp
thinking the end of entries represents a keyboard shortcut (e.g. 'Home').

Netscape's handling of 'meta http-equiv="refresh"' is to start counting
when the fetch has completed and everything else has died down. The browser
will now not start counting until the animation handler is deregistered
(so formatting is complete) to show similar behaviour (note that this
checks the main handler, not the 'idle but returning to first frame'
drift handler).

URLs from requests for fetches by Plug-Ins are now relativised.

Page width change tolerance prior to reformat upped from 16 to 32 OS
units. Hoping to provoke a loosely connected bug with this change!

TableOuter, TableInner and SeeFetches choices added to all Choices
files, with appropriate loading and saving code in Main.c and Save.c.
AuthorFTP and AuthorFSh messages added for FTP authentication, and
dialogue handling code (the component in FetchHTML.c) updated to
recognise an FTP fetch and alter the dialogue presentation
appropriately.

All Messages file version numbers taken up to 1.27 (20 Nov 1997).

Following a UseNet suggestion, Ctrl+Toggle Size will increase the window
size to fill the screen vertically only; horizontal size/positioning is
not changed.

Shift+Tab in the URL writable will cycle through alternative fetcher
protocols (from both the Controls file and checking the fetcher modules
are actually present).

Hotlist doesn't require '://' in URLs when loading HTML, just ':/' - so
'file:/' URLs now will be reloaded correctly.

History system rewritten completely. GHistSize and VHistSize options
removed, and replaced by MaxSize and ExpiryAge. Now have global history
menus with most recently visited items at the top, and local history
menus which reflect the path that forward/back buttons would take.
Browsers are robust to background expiry of the History though this is
not implemented - date expiry and size checks are carried out on
history_record only. This does mean that with two windows open one could
have the history expired underneath it whilst another fetched, though;
the code handles this and update toolbars (greying items) as necessary.
It is possible to have the history limits so tight that even one entry
will not fit and again the code copes with this, though values read
from Choices are limit checked to ensure rather more useful results!

Implemented 'Save' button in save dialogues. Remembers pathnames and just
replaces the leaf now (hard coded exceptions for <Wimp$Scrap>... and
<Wimp$ScrapDir>...) - it did before, but only if you'd typed the path
in. Not many people did, given that you couldn't press Return or click on
a Save button to use that path...

In a similar vein, files of type Data or DOS will be checked for a '/xxx'
type extension and the MimeMap module will be used to find a more meaningful
filetype. If this can be handled, the file is loaded. This only works for
files dragged to the browser - the behaviour with inline data in web pages
will depend on the File module, and similarly, if File doesn't spot what is
going on and claims that the object is data, the browser will just open a
save dialogue for it.

!RunD files taken up to 3072K WimpSlot.

Hotlist's saved HTML page title wasn't internationalised - is now. This
opened up a significant can of worms; on file write error, the file would
never be closed, and if a caller of the save or load functions passed
in a filename held in the global Messages lookup buffer then subsequent
lookups in the callees would corrupt that filename. All sorted out now.

Local (not very useful) or global (useful) histories can be saved as HTML,
which opens up the possibility of sending your history to the hotlist
by saving to it. Local and global histories can also be emptied, though
this is probably not a feature that current release Desktop browsers need.
Inheritance of local history and certain UI features is now done more or
less for all cases where one browser window spawns another, too.

Vertical alignment on images is rather less ropey than it was (e.g.
ALIGN=TOP stands half a chance of working) but is still far from perfect.
This was part of fixing a nasty little bug in Redraw.c's setting of
an image position via. image_set_token_image_position, which was making
(amongst possibly many other things) client side image maps fail.
Image update where images had large borders was affected by a similar
problem too (more cans with more worms...).

Fixed image background filler functions; two problems. When cross
referenced images were replaced by base images in a browser because the
original owner was closing down, the original owner browser would stay
registered with ImageLib. Fixed; secondly, when images were deleted from
the image array causing those above to be renumbered, images registered
with ImageLib did not have their numbers updated (this was the one that
lead to the visible drop out of background images with PNGs on the Acorn
Internet home page when there were two views of the page and the first
was closed). This is now also sorted out.

@Now handles PARAM tags. Sorted out Plug-In bug that was related to Java
setting a 0 by 0 graphics window before calling Wimp_Poll (fixed in Java).
Implemented queue for Plug-Ins so multiple broadcasts aren't sent for
several Objects in one data chunk.

Added Docs directory with some documentation in it. More things to keep
checking for stylistic consistency, horray ;-)

Corrected !Run[D] for Ursula build to need AcornURI but not TaskModule
(URI handler needed for !Mail to pick up mailto: links).

Added display_height field to browser_data, analogous to display_width,
to cope with % sized objects by width and height (see how HRs are
handled in Redraw.c for an example of how it was always fairly easy
with width, but not height until this addition). Though you do have
to reload to get a new size; reformat isn't enough. Must see to this
some time...

Fixed bug where basic typefaces were claimed *before* the Choices file
had been read. For unusual Choices settings, this could create some
'interesting' problems now and again. This was part of narrower scope
work in the Choices code to allow font changing without leaking font
handles (now done; fm_shutdown only ditches fonts, it keeps internal
structures - must then call  fm_lose_fonts for all browsers to get the
bitfields up to date, then rewrite the typeface definitions and reclaim
basic fonts). Noticed that fm_claim_basic_typefaces would claim multiple
instances of the same font if there were several cases of the same font
mapped to different typeface styles - fixed.

Implemented PlugInControl settings, but not SupportObject (fully).

@More reformatter code bugs fixed; this one regarding width of items. Any

Crude Plug-In support; just about manages Java, but can't fetch on
behalf of Plug-In (for example). Had to change the default file access
URL construction to be 'file:/' instead of 'file://', or local file
fetches that reference Java applets won't work. This is in its very
early stages, and is being checked in mostly so that various Choices
issues can be worked on.

in Controls updated for Gopher. Debug builds now require 2760K rather than
2560K. Font$... variables set if not already, in anticipation of font
Choices work.

Additional bits in Choices section of Res file tidied and some name
changes (e.g. Netscape -> Navigator(TM)). Frames support option added
to Choices.

Grouped 'support_frames' under the Fetch Controls section and added
support_object in Global.h; appropriate entries placed in the Choices
files, and are read at startup. At present, though, only the frames
support flag is implemented.

For some reason, Menu was the button to use on history popups if you
wanted to show URLs instead of descriptions (or vice versa, depending
on Choices settings). Now, Select and Menu will show the Choices
defined setting, and Adjust will show the opposite.

History menus are built backwards, so local histories have the most
recently visited pages at the top. Global history has still no real
order to it, but this may be arranged later.

Customer name changed to Customer by request.

Customer browser now gets its own resources (SYSTEM=Customer), but
otherwise is unchanged, with the Ursula build now giving the
'spinning acorn' with a Bookworm-style toolbar. This is used for the
Desktop !Browse build.

!Sprites[22] files updated to include GIF, JPEG and PNG sprites;

@Added support for HTMLLib HttpEndParse call.

Text items with no VALUE specified in the HTML were not cleared on
hitting a Reset button as the text field of the token is NULL; fixed.
SELECT lists with no default selection item were not being changed
on hitting a Reset button; fixed. In radio groups with no default
selection specified, no item will be selected. This goes against
the HTML 2 spec but allows broken Navigator-esque forms behaviour.
In consequence, radios can be deselected by clicking on the same
one twice. I'd fixed the flickering experienced when doing this
recently, but that, now, is irrelevant, since the state of a radio
must always change.

Reformatter's new 'find width of a SELECT field' didn't account for
the width of <none> and <many> items, and now does (particularly
important for broken items with no OPTION contents).

Under certain circumstances, illegally named targets would open in the
ancestor rather than a new window - a deliberate decision in the code,
but now reversed due to a test suite failure; they'll open in a new
window instead.

Altered the left hand indent handling for lists so that headings and
body text follow the Navigator 48 pixel indent and the bullet point
items drop to the left of the left hand margin, rather than sitting
on the margin with the text indented to the right.

Tightened up the hotlist_load_directory checking of URLs, so that
only those with '://' in - i.e. look fully specified - are accepted.
HTML files are loaded into a new directory now.

Items without a descriptive title in hotlist_new_url will have the URL
substituted in instead. White space before and after descriptions and
after URLs is stripped. Directories with zero length names or null
strings (after white space is stripped) will still be created, with a
generic name (see Messages, token 'HotlistUntitled').

default body (serif, so to speak) font as it matches the box's look and
feel better).

Font loading altered a bit to work properly! Font library defines some
standard startup fonts without using Choices, which Choices can then
override.

@Now working on source merged with Kevin Bracey's internationalisation
support. UNIFONT is undefined in the Make File for now. All Res and
Choices files updated appropriately.

Having sorted out the old Choices and Messages to form Choices, Controls
and Messages, this build has had the same cleaning up done internally.
This includes greater consistency in naming schemes and the removal of
the inconsitent choices items - e.g. Choices file entries saying 'delay
images' and 'plain backgrounds' where internally all the flags say 'show
images' and 'show backgrounds'. ChoiceDefs.h and CtrlDefs.h added to
clarify the meaning of some fields, though usage of these is not 100%
in the source (there are cases where parameters are passed through to
functions as ints, and those functions still check these against hard
coded values rather than the #define stuff).

Fetcher status return bits (connected, sent request, etc.) now reflected
in status bar. Progress during fetchs to files are reported by %, where
the size of the object is known. Exceeding 100% drops back to a byte
counter, in case the estimated size was wrong. The progress counter
may be updated after specific delays, rather than 'as often as possible',
to reduce flicker (as requested by D.Brown some time ago).

I've done a small rewrite of the fetch prioritisation scheme in FetchPage.c;
how well this performs in general use across different processor speeds
remains to be tested, but certainly it has some advantages. For each small
fetch window before the rewrite, a 4cs tight loop was entered - this gave a
noticable and substantial drain to the Desktop performance if more than one
was opened. Now, several can be up at once with little hit. The actual file
fetch is on half the priority it was before, with all others taken back
just a bit - e.g. from 20cs per poll to 15cs per poll for flat out
reformatting. You don't seem to lose much time on the format in practice,
and the Desktop feels quite a bit lighter at the same time. There's the
potential for smoother frameset loading in this scheme, too.

When Shift+Clicking on a link meant you still fetched inside the main
browser window, several fetches could occur in a frameset - one per frame.
However, now that you can only do this by clicking on a link that leads to
non-displayable data - or by turning off the small fetch windows by
setting UseSmall to 'no' in Choices - a bug where fetchpage_preprocessed
would stop such fetches as new ones were started was revealed.
The API to frames_abort_fetching has now been extended to include a
'stop file spooling too' flag, allowing a fix to be made by having
fetchpage_preprocess's calls not set this (and it doesn't check the
savelink flag is unset before proceeding, since frames_abort_fetching
does that implicitly now).

Had left the RAM transfer buffer at 16 bytes (from testing) accidentally...
Oops. Upped it to 4K. In addition, when loading data by RAM transfer,
the browser didn't notice if a RAMFetch bounced during the transfer. It
would be treated as a 'first' RAMFetch bounce, basically, and try to go to
file transfer - oops. Fixed.

@Support for ANT URL broadcast message added.

Image deletion routines rewritten; nasty animated GIF bug now gone
(it kept trying to update the cross-referenced image in the browser that
no longer existed, and I've no idea how animated GIFs ever managed to *not*
blow up if a cross referencing browser was shut down; and I've tested
this...). There are now as many image structures as there are total images
in the visible browsers, and no more; cross referenced images in the
to-be-deleted browser have their ownership moved to the cross
referencer before the cross referencee is wiped, with any required fetches
being transferred with them.

Reformatter sped up a bit by getting rid of strlen on the main text field
of tokens in all places bar one, where it is called extremely rarely. This
means direct app-to-app transfer of, say, a 359K text file to the browser
won't run like a drain as it tries to do strlen on a 359K string over and
over again! Most of the time the performance benefits won't really be
noticable, but on the above text file, formatting time went down from
290 seconds before the change to just under 7 seconds, a 41 fold speed
increase or thereabouts (SA110 228MHz).

MakeFile changed to force function name compilation on for debug builds
(-fn in the DD...FLAGS); useful for certain functions such as
register_null_handler, which can now output the name of the function
being registered.

...Which helped show up some nasties in the animation handler and animation
drift handler registration/deregistration process, which have been fixed
(callers of fetchpage_release_nulls were unaware that the drift handler
could be installed, and fragments of old code checking choices.anim_drift
had a value other than 1 or 0 were still hanging around - bit tricky for
a single bit item).

Added support for VALIGN in table cells. Spotted a bug or two in the
'what token is the pointer over' routines as a result, and fixed them - the
worst was in browser_line_at_y, which checked the y coordinate was below
the given one [the mouse], but didn't check the line height to see if the
given y coordinate was *within* the line, rather than just above it. Never
used to matter pre-tables, but a definite concern once multiple line
arrays can exist on one page.

@Got the deferred reformatter working properly. It doesn't do that 'OK,
the page is fetched and reformatted, but just to annoy you, I'm going
to wait 5 seconds and then suddenly reformat the whole thing again'
trick anymore. The fetcher was calling the reformatter in a delayed
form even when the reformatter was already running, so it would carry
on past the reformat point or from below what had become and invalidated
line, and some time later, get back to the delayed reformat. Now,
reformatting is only delayed by the fetcher when the reformatter is not
running. In practice this means body text reformats as it fetches, but
large tables will show delayed reformatting - which was exactly the
intended behaviour of the feature when it was originally thought of.

fetch_token_data_address removed; it was only needed in two places,
both of which already knew when to read tp->text and when to ignore
it. Its functionality is duplicated in an 'if' involving reformat_istext,
anyway.

!Run[D] files taken back to requiring HTTP 0.33, since 0.36 introduces
many weird and wonderful problems.

Typo in Messages files, 'All current images (sic.) fetches finished' -
'images' is now 'image'.

Shift+Click saving - you could save to an application. No problem. But
the equivalent (just clicking on a link that led to an unknown datatype
and getting the save dialogue that way) didn't work. It does now.
Another problem was saving to an application that didn't support the
datatype - oops, the dialogue would close but the fetch would sit there
waiting to be told where to save. It doesn't close now (as expected).

NB, doing several simultaneous fetches to a text editor may have problems
as the editors are too clever for their own good. Despite receiving
DataLoad messages for <Wimp$Scrap> for files of different types, sizes
and datestamps, the editors can decide it's still the same file and:

Zap      - Hats off, it gets it right, almost. You do get warned 'Multiple
           copies - one on disc is newer' as everything after the first
           text loads, but they do load, and in separate windows.
StrongED - Does not load the subsequent files, so the browser gives 'Data
           transfer failed' errors and opens up Scrap. Turning off 'Don't
           load same file twice' fixes it - each file is loaded in a new
           window with no warnings. At least in the first case, you don't
           lose data, since the files are kept in Scrap.
Edit     - Each time it loads the file, it *replaces* the other one in
           memory, using the same window for each. This is the worst
           behaviour as it isn't configurable (well, I don't know of a way
           to change it...) and results in data loss as successive texts
           get trounced by the new data.

I can't see how I can fix this in the browser as it's basically silly
behaviour on behalf of the editors. Other applications which don't try
to work out if it's a new file or not are fine!

When conducting image fetches, proxying is allowed unless reloading.
When conducting page fetches, proxying was never allowed - so web cache
stuff would have been, er, interesting. It now sets X-NoProxy: in the
request header when reloading, but otherwise this is not included.

AnimSpeed is, at last, independent of browser poll speed. They used to
be tied together. Guess how the animation code used to work ;-)

'Can't handle this datatype' - deprecated now that save dialogues can be
popped up. The 'can't save objects in full screen mode' error would never
be shown due to a bug, anyway; this now replaces 'can't handle', which
has been removed from all Messages files.

RefoWait, RefoHang and RefoTime moved from Controls back to Choices.

Trying to get rid of strlen in the reformatter - it can get very slow
(e.g. strlen of 8K chunks of text, or if a 330K text file is transferred
from a text editor straight to the browser, strlen of a 330K string...).
There will be unfinished bits of code in the reformatter that may seem
unnecessary - they've just not been plugged in yet (since they don't
actually work). Don't remove them!

@Created Protocols source file and moved a lot of message handling from
handle_messages - the latter now serves as a high level distributor to
lower level functions in Protocols. Incidentally, URL files (as used by
the ANT suite) can be loaded by dragging to the browser in the same way
as URI files - Not A Lot Of People Know That, etc.

Merged new hotlist display type Res file to existing resources, added
support for DataSave message so items can be dragged from the hotlist
to a specific window (RAM transfer for URI and URL files; ScrapFile for
HTML and Text but deleted afterwards and there are appropriate guards
to stop Reload just saying 'not found'; images run through ScrapFile and
there is no choice but to leave them there and do a conventional fetch).

All !RunD files now give a WimpSlot of 2304K. Some small changes to
the Argo and Ursula build Res files to make the menu trees more sensible.
Controls files now take 'file:/' instead of 'file://' in Protocols
section. Definitions at top of URLutils.c *not* altered, as then you
end up with invalid URLs - so it will accept 'file:/', but always generate
'file://'. This is because some browsers exports 'file:/'. Sigh.

make_no_[..._]memory_error functions now return a _kernel_oserror * rather
than void. It's always &erb returned, but it enables users to use a more
elegant 'return make_no_memory_error(1);', say, rather than something
like 'make_no_memory_error(1); return &erb;'. I obviously should've written
it like that at the outset, but never mind. All callers have been
appropriately updated.

The urlutils_leafname_from_url function now replaces illegal characters
(A7000 Welcome Guide p54...) in the leaf with legal alternatives.

Internal URL scheme is now a bit cleaner, with everything properly defined
in URLutils.h. All references to http:, file: and ftp:, with or without
a following '//' use the definitions in here now.

More tidying and some reorganising of Hotlist source. Auto-open delay is
now a Choices item. Some dependencies on statics removed (e.g. the
counting functions don't accumulate into the global item_number now).
The redraw functions used Wimp_TextOp - oops, so this has been amended
to use whatever is supported on your Wimp. This is now in a new function
(utils_text_width()), which the History menu routines also use (there was
a bug in the width routine there anyway, which is therefore fixed in
passing). Several other routines used Wimp_TextOp directly too, and
they have been altered to use the new function as well.

In hotlist code, one of the larger changes is in the API to hotlist_draw_r()
(formerly _hotlist_draw()) which now takes item widths and heights as
parameters - discovering these is quite slow, so doing it every time the
function calls itself recursively is a little less efficient than
passing the values in from elsewhere. Note that underscore prefixed
functions are being slowly renamed to _r suffixed functions, to match
the convention established by Tony Cheal with is table routines. This
makes it much more obvious when something is recursive, as the same
naming convention is used in every browser source file.

Finally, note that I intend to ditch SaveDBox and use an alternate window
with manual control of the messaging in Protocols.c. This will allow
various improvements which at present the SaveDBox operational methods
preclude. I'm going to have to do at least an alternate Window object for
the SaveDBox module to use soon in any case. Getting rid of SaveDBox will
help reduce, if only slightly, demands on the RMA.

log
@Very long log entry alert - but hey, beats 'Bug fixed' (sorry, Richard) ;-)

Open URL implementation more or less complete, though may undergo UI
revision at a later date to allow named frames to be targetted. Hope to use
the ideas in this code as the foundation for other general dialogues.

In token stream dump for TRACE builds, table head items were not indented
as far as they should have been - this is fixed; and manual toolbar redraw
routines have been removed. They never worked, were commented out, and
would never be used in that form anyway.

DragBox source added, but it isn't at all complete and won't work - this is
an 'in spare time' thing. We need custom drag boxes constrained to windows
for the hotlist, and unconstrained for frame border resizing... Hey ho.

Ancestor window extents match visible areas if there are frames (no more
scrolling framesets...!). Frame resizing works whilst new documents fetch
without pulling the extent down now. However, frame horizontal extents
never shrink until a reload which is nasty, and this is all due for a
rewrite. Frames border redrawing routine moved out of Redraw.c and into
Frames.c. Bug regarding the mouse rectangle and frame border widths
(rectangle was too large, so you could squash the edges) for edge-drag
frame resizes fixed.

Window width change reformat tolerance fixed; you could creep the window
width down or up forever without any reformat, and centred objects would
move but not be redrawn (thereby giving rise to subsequent redraw errors).

Filetype on objects saved through Shift+Click correct. Save Source dialogue
recognises if that source is plain text, rather than assuming HTML. A
browser that fetches a file remembers the old store size it had before the
save, so even though the data is now ditched, it reports the same amount of
data fetched afterwards (looked awful when this could, for example,
suddenly say '0' after a file save). Progress indicator is now fully aware
of one or many file saves inside a frameset and reports the number of
saves, a colon, and the cumulative saved data count, instead of reporting
the sum total of fetched data in all frames, including non-file save stuff
(note that for just 1 save, '1:' is not shown as a special case for the
most common condition). A bug related to this, where you could in fact only
do one fetch per frame*set*, has been corrected (only one fetch allowed per
frame still, this is unlikely to ever change).

Hotlist support added (D.Brown's source), with various bits of integration
and modification still in progress there. Note additions to the Messages
files. On the subject of Messages, the whole mucky business about what
goes in Messages or Choices (and a few bugs where lookup_choice was used
instead of lookup_token or vice versa) has been sorted out. Messages
contains, more or less, just that. Choices contains user configurable
stuff which generally can't mess things up too badly. A new file, Controls,
is a Messages file holding the non-user configurable choices, which can
generally make things go badly wrong if misused. A lot of these are tied
to the Res file. StrongED users can get these to automatically fold out
the various sections (EMail me for details). Sorry, but at the time of
writing, Zap doesn't do folding... =8*P

Two bugs with images. Asking for images to be shown in browser B when
browser A uses the same ones and was loaded first didn't work correctly,
and now does (a bit weird - browser A does the fetch and browser B does the
display...). Second one occurred when the background image was also used on
the page as a foreground image. This has been fixed by flagging background
images in the image_info structure, and checking this before cross
referencing. This bit also allowed the image_restart_fetches API to be
extended, so that just background or foreground images may be fetched if
they weren't already and the user asked the browser to show them. Before,
the whole lot had to be fetched together (so turning on 'display
backgrounds' will now kick off an image fetch if required, you don't
need to reload the page anymore).

Makefile copy options tweaked to be 'newer' (so if you're testing with some
temporary Choices file or something, it won't write over it at the end of
every export), and REMOTE_HOTLIST flag added for Customer builds - means
the Hotlist.c functions aren't needed; the old, hotlist-by-file method is
used. Added support for Customer build (see later), though there were very
few additions needed in practice.

Table printing fixed - in many ways it wasn't broken, it was image printing
causing the oddities ever since the global image pool was introduced (this
is, again, fixed). The 'reformat to fit page' option didn't work as coded
any more; tables store cell addresses in the HStreams, so you can't then do
a background reformat in a different browser. Hence, it now has to reformat
to the page width, print, then put the page back again, all in the actual
displayed browser. This doesn't feel as slow in use as it perhaps should,
considering what is going on... Note that a line of a defined fraction (see
Print.h) of page height will now split over page boundaries, so tall images
or tall tables don't cause problems now (aside from the obvious problem of
having the line split over a page at all!). There was a bug in the routine
to print from a given start point until 'n' pages had been filled, in that
it always filled 'n + 1' - now fixed. Finally, as part of the printing
tweaks, a new dialogue exists - PrintStyle - with a similarly named source
file added to deal with it.

Global history auto save / load done, but only to the Choices file path -
the whole browser is still strictly single user at present, with all the
extra work for a multiuser Customer environment yet to be done. This has
shown up a global history corruption problem which I haven't fixed yet.

Rationalising TBEvents.h - things are migrating out of it, and into more
appropriate sources (e.g. definitions relating to the Open URL dialogue are
going into OpenURL.h, etc.). Event codes were at one stage deliberately
diverged in numberspace from the component IDs of typical gadgets raising
the events, to avoid anyone getting confused and thinking the IDs and event
codes must match. However, this is in fact unlikely and it is much easier
to remember the fewer numbers that result from tying the two together where
possible. This has resulted in changes to event codes raised in the
following objects of all Res files: Authorise, Find, OpenURL, and
PrintStyle.

And finally - !Run[D] files for all variants updated to require the latest
toolbox and fetcher modules. All Res files updated for hotlists etc. and
sprites files updated appropriately. All Messages, Choices and Controls
files brought in sync., and an Customer build has been added (based on the
Desktop build binary with different resources).

That's all for now...

1.2
log
@Forgot to mention last time that frames can now be resized by dragging the
borders and there's a partial implementation of saving foreign objects out
of the page. Shift-click on a link to fetch to a file; objects that can't
be rendered on the page will automatically generate a Save dialogue whether
shift is held down or not. The action of Shift+Click on images has now been
moved to Ctrl+Click. Anyway, in *this* check-in, the Resources directory
has got some attention - added pointer sprites, a few message tokens, etc.

# SystemFont   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' browser will only use system font on
#                the page (fast and clear, but pretty ugly...).

# DelayImage   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' images will not be loaded until
#                they are told to load. Otherwise they load as part of the
#                main page fetch.

# FixedPtr     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the pointer will change shape as it
#                moves over certain objects on the page (e.g. a link).
#                Otherwise it stays the standard pointer shape, over the page.
# HighlightLks - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will

# KeyboardCtl  - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' links (and some other objects) will
#                be selectable from the keyboard.
# ClearFirst   - 'yes' or 'no', only relevant for UI designs where the
#                URL writable and status bars are merged. In such UIs,
#                pressing an alphanumeric key when in status mode will
#                change to writable mode and, if this is 'yes', put the
#                key value into the writable, clearing whatever was there
#                beforehand first. If 'no', then the value of the key is
#                appended to whatever is in the writable.
# KeepHighlight- 'yes' or 'no'. If 'yes', frames will be (re)highlighted
#                whenever keyboard navigated. If 'no', they are only
#                highlighted when initially selected.

# LeftMargin   - Basic left hand page margin (before list indents etc.), in
#                millipoints.
# RightMargin  - Similarly, the basic right hand page margin in millipoints.
# QuoteMargin  - Extra page margin for a <blockquote> section of text.
# Leading      - Line spacing in OS units (pronounced 'ledding'). Note that
#                negative numbers are allowed but may produce redraw
#                artifacts under some circumstances, so use with caution.
# LeftIndent   - Multiplier used to work out left hand indent of text for
#                list items etc., in millipoints.
# MinFrmHeight - Minimum height a frame may take when initially sized or
#                subsequently resized, in OS units.
# MinFrmWidth  - Similarly, the minimum frame width.

# DefURLbar    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have URL
#                bars present.
# DefButtonBar - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have button
#                bars present.
# DefStatusBar - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' new browser windows will have status
#                bars present.
# MoveGadgets  - '0', '1', or '2'. If '0', gadgets are never moved on the
#                toolbars to fit inside the window. If '1', gadgets are moved
#                at the end of any resize actions. If '2', gadgets are moved
#                during resize actions.
# AnimDrift    - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the status bar animation will drift
#                over to the first starting sprite before stopping. Otherwise
#                it will stop as soon as the browser is idle.
# SolidResize  - 'yes', 'no' or 'always'. If 'yes' frame border resizes will
#                be solid, unless the CMOS RAM window solid resize bit is
#                clear. If 'no', frame border resizes will not be solid (a
#                dashed outline shows what the window sizes are).
#                If 'always', the drag is always solid regardless of CMOS
#                RAM settings.

# FullScreen   - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the window will open full screen,
#                else it will open at the default page size.
# HScroll      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a horizontal scroll bar will be
#                visible when Full Screen. Can also have 'auto', to
#                add or remove scroll bars automatically, if the Wimp
#                variant the browser runs on supports this. If the
#                Wimp doesn't, this will work the same as 'yes'.
# VScroll      - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' a vertical scroll bar will be
#                visible when Full Screen. As for HScroll, can also
#                have 'auto' with the right Wimp.

# MaxImages    - Maximum number of images that may be simultaneously fetched.
#                Must be between 1 and 255, though values over about 25 are
#                more likely to degrade performance than improve it.

# GHistSize    - Maximum global history size, in K.
# VHistSize    - Maximum view history size, in entries.
# HistoryPath  - Global history default load/save path.
# HotlistPath  - Hotlist default load/save path.
# ShowURLs     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the History menu will always only
#                contain URLs. Otherwise it will hold page titles (where
#                available).
# SaveHistory  - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the global history will always be
#                saved to disc on browser exit, else it will never be saved.
# SaveHotlist  - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the hotlist will always be saved to
#                disc on browser exit, else it will never be saved (in which
#                case changes during a browser session will be lost, so this
#                should be used with caution).

# RefoWait     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the browser will wait for a time
#                determined by 'RefoTime' (see below) before doing a page
#                reformat - can be useful if frequent reformats when unsized
#                images come in (for example) are proving annoying.
# RefoHang     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will not reformat past an
#                unsized image - the browser will wait until that image's
#                size is known. For slow sites this may take a long time.
#                [Unimplemented]
# RefoTime     - If RefoWait is 'yes', the time in centiseconds between
#                queued reformats (urgent reformats may force this earlier
#                though - e.g. document fetch completed).
# BrickWall    - If 'yes', then clicking on 'Stop' or following new links
#                will immediately stop *all* fetch/reformat activity,
#                or for targetted links, will stop such activity in the
#                target. This is a fairly specialised option as normally
#                continued cacheing (if a local proxy is present) or
#                continued background fetching is desirable (may as well
#                take advantage of otherwise idle time this way).

# PrintCopies  - Default number of copies to print. Must be at least 1!
# PrintStart   - 'start' to print from the start of the web page, 'visible'
#                to print from the top of the region visible in the browser
#                window.
# PrintEnd     - 'end' to print to the end of the web page, 'visible' to
#                print to the bottom of the region visible in the browser
#                window, else a number greater than 0 for the number of pages
#                to fill up after starting printing at the given start point.
# PrintReform  - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' the page will be reformatted to fit
#                the paper size (else it is printed at a width determined by
#                the browser window, which may mean it overflows the right
#                hand edge of the paper or does not use the full page width).
#                Reformatting can take quite a long time, hence this is
#                optional. When using 'visible' for PrintStart or PrintEnd,
#                this option is ignored and reformatting does not take place,
#                as reformatting would change the visible region, if it was
#                done in the window rather than internally for the printer.
# PrintOrient  - 'upright' or 'sideways', which pretty much says it all.

# Typeface1    - Typeface definitions. The syntax of these is fairly
# Typeface2      strict and slightly complex, so they should only
# Typeface3      be altered through a front-end dialogue in the
# Typeface4      browser.

# UseProxy     - 'yes' or 'no', if 'yes' proxying will be used so the value
#                of the next two items is important.
# ProxyAddress - The base URL of the proxy server to use, such as
#                'http://wwwcache.demon.co.uk/'.
