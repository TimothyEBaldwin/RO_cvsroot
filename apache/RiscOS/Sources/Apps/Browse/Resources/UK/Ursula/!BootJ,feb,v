log
@  PDF export, some major redraw structural changes, updated resources,
  new build system, extensive Makefile modifications, const/restrict
  additions, various bug fixes.
Detail:
  PDF export facility. SEE Docs.User FOR DETAILS (important!). Includes
  UI for headers/footers in Choices and option switch in Print dialogue
  box. Minor bug fixes include printing bullet points and, at long last,
  the "print dialogue box contents are not set up" problem. Redraw engine
  now based entirely on function pointers. Draw export routine replaces
  screen output functions with Draw output functions; PDF does similar.
  Coordinate scaling system in Scale.c/h to help. Makefile changes: Now
  supports a more consistent set of build variants and has minimal
  duplication of object and library lists. New build system: !Mk...
  script files removed, FrontEnd tool !MkBrowse replaces it. See !ReadMe
  (replacing old ReadMe) in root for details. Requires FrontEnd 1.29,
  HTMLLib 0.02 and ImageLib 0.04 (by CVS VersionNum). Updated resources:
  Some attempt to bring all variants to a working level, but not much
  testing. Only the Phoenix JavaScript capable builds (Unicode or normal)
  are fully up to date, though, including PDF UI additions. Many other
  minor tweaks, and extensive use of const and restrict qualifiers
  propagated through source code in response to their use in the new
  redraw system.
Admin:
  Draw and PDF export tested quite heavily. Appears to work well. Text
  file 'Docs.User' describes limitations. Note required new module and
  library versions listed above. Note that only JavaScript capable
  Phoenix resources are updated and only Phoenix was heavily tested.

Version 2.12. Tagged as 'Browse-2_12'

@Tweaks to export rules in Makefile - ResJ source for JavaScript builds,
all of User dir exported, resources rule exports About as well as User.

Handles images with a width or height of 0 specified in the HTML.
Previously went for a default size placeholder and changes to image
sizes and/or redraw problems could occur before/after subsequent
reformatting (involved trivial changes to image_get_image_size and
image_redraw_area only).

Default parameter HRs now plot properly in rectangular pixel modes.

Choices code updated to cope with the minimum font size, JS support,
watchdog on/off and timeout, Navigator object option added generally
(act even *more* like Navigator), image GC after fetch, and image
GC unused image / free RAM constraints.

Code in JSnavigator.c updated to obey new "act more like Navigator"
option (see above). Currently declares itself as version 3.0.

Resources for all builds are up to date. All links in default hotlist
verified and corrected where necessary, with several new links added.

This is Release v2.07. Not tested very much, sorry; YMMV.

log
@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.
