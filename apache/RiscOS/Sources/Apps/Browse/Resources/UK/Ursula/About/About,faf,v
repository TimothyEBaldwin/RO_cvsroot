@Intermediate check-in; building a browser from this gives you something
between 2.07 and 2.08. Only the Phoenix JavaScript resources are fully
up to date.

I *think* these are the changes since the last check-in:

When saved as a Draw file, horizontal rules were plotted one page width
too far to the right (wonder when that started happening?!). Fixed. In
addition, DrawFiles now accepted as OBJECTs - they weren't in the
recognised filetype list before. Doh.

Table size calculator tables_count_table would overestimate the number
of cells where ROWSPAN was present and there were other rows below the
one spanned. Fixed. In certain odd cases (e.g. optimised image exports
as HTML tables (!!) from the Gimp) this can save vast amounts of RAM.

Fixed problem where printing stops in the middle of a document. Redraw
engine pagination code was written in the days where lines couldn't
have gaps between them; they can now. If a gap fell at the bottom of
a page the engine would look down, see no line straddling or touching
the page edge, and assume there was nothing more. This case is now
correctly handled.

Made sure desktop and testbed Browse Res files had up-to-date Encoding
menus (v2.07 Phoenix has different menus from v2.07 Browse by oversight).

URL auto-completion piggy-backed onto manual completion code; any string
without '.', '/' or ':' in it gets run through completion to see if a
more meaningful item can be produced - "www" special cased out though.

New List dialogue box handler, used for proxy exclusions etc.
(incomplete), complete with appropriate Res file objects.

@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.
