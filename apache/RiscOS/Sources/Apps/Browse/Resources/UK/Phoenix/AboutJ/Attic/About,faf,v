@  Completion of v2.11 check-in of Phoenix (note that the application
  gets its reported version number and date from Messages, not the
  VersionNum file, which updates independently).
Detail:
  Various resources updated. New About stuff included. Modification to
  Hotlist.c to ask DragAnObject to *really* call it in USR mode; requires
  DragAnObject 0.09. New "RMTry" utility in Phoenix to help make finding
  up to date modules more friendly - works well in itself but slows down
  the loading time quite a bit; would be nice to find a better solution.
  This will do in the short term, as it's a definite improvement over
  the way the !Run files used to work.
Admin:
  Use of DragAnObject 0.09 fixes aborts when trying to drag items around
  in the hotlist.

Version 2.10. Tagged as 'Browse-2_10'

@  Load balancer pulled apart. DebugLib support. Temporary debug in place.
Detail:
  This is in the middle of some load balancer changes, but I'm checking it
  in as there's a sweeping source code change to use DebugLib. See Global.c
  for full details. Temporary debug code for the load balancer stuff is
  currently held under undocumented area "test".
Admin:
  This build now identifies itself as 2.08 i2-4 and says Pace on the about:
  page. Run for some time with no unexpected problems. Tried a mixture of
  debug levels successfully.

Version 2.08. Not tagged

@Intermediate check-in; building a browser from this gives you something
between 2.07 and 2.08. Only the Phoenix JavaScript resources are fully
up to date.

I *think* these are the changes since the last check-in:

When saved as a Draw file, horizontal rules were plotted one page width
too far to the right (wonder when that started happening?!). Fixed. In
addition, DrawFiles now accepted as OBJECTs - they weren't in the
recognised filetype list before. Doh.

Table size calculator tables_count_table would overestimate the number
of cells where ROWSPAN was present and there were other rows below the
one spanned. Fixed. In certain odd cases (e.g. optimised image exports
as HTML tables (!!) from the Gimp) this can save vast amounts of RAM.

Fixed problem where printing stops in the middle of a document. Redraw
engine pagination code was written in the days where lines couldn't
have gaps between them; they can now. If a gap fell at the bottom of
a page the engine would look down, see no line straddling or touching
the page edge, and assume there was nothing more. This case is now
correctly handled.

Made sure desktop and testbed Browse Res files had up-to-date Encoding
menus (v2.07 Phoenix has different menus from v2.07 Browse by oversight).

URL auto-completion piggy-backed onto manual completion code; any string
without '.', '/' or ':' in it gets run through completion to see if a
more meaningful item can be produced - "www" special cased out though.

New List dialogue box handler, used for proxy exclusions etc.
(incomplete), complete with appropriate Res file objects.

@Tweaks to export rules in Makefile - ResJ source for JavaScript builds,
all of User dir exported, resources rule exports About as well as User.

Handles images with a width or height of 0 specified in the HTML.
Previously went for a default size placeholder and changes to image
sizes and/or redraw problems could occur before/after subsequent
reformatting (involved trivial changes to image_get_image_size and
image_redraw_area only).

Default parameter HRs now plot properly in rectangular pixel modes.

Choices code updated to cope with the minimum font size, JS support,
watchdog on/off and timeout, Navigator object option added generally
(act even *more* like Navigator), image GC after fetch, and image
GC unused image / free RAM constraints.

Code in JSnavigator.c updated to obey new "act more like Navigator"
option (see above). Currently declares itself as version 3.0.

Resources for all builds are up to date. All links in default hotlist
verified and corrected where necessary, with several new links added.

This is Release v2.07. Not tested very much, sorry; YMMV.

@Everyone else seems to be checking lots of stuff in lately, so I've
decided to join in. This is an intermediate check-in and so not all
resources etc. will be up to date. You should be able to make Phoenix
and a debug build out of it. As a reminder, to make a JavaScript build:

 * Build JSLib and NSPRLib. Recommend you leave -DUSEMEMLIB in there (as
   used by default) so you can watch it leak into a dynamic area... :-)
   If you do this, you'll need to build MemLib too, of course. If you
   do NOT use MemLib, *undefine JS_USING_MEMLIB in Main.c*!
 * Run !MkClean. This now strips dynamic dependencies from the MakeFile
   automatically, to save you having to do it yourself.
 * Run one of the TaskObey files with the "J" suffix, e.g. !DeskBrwsJ -
   this uses the same .o directory for object files and exports to the
   same position in the Targets directory as the non-JavaScript build,
   but it does produce a unique binary in 'abs' and symbols table in
   'syms'.
 * Sourcing an appropriate !Run (with increased WimpSlot value), !Boot
   and About resource is done automatically.
 * Some, but not all of the !xxxD (debug) TaskObey files will make
   JavaScript versions in passing - check the JSUFFIX value on the Make
   command line parameters in the file.

This'll only work on RISC OS 3.1 due to the use of MemLib.

Here's the change list:

Included MNG icons in sprites files; added Sprites23 for some builds.
Added in ANT URL file icon (b28) derived from URI file icon, because
the Save dialogue can need it.

No, you do *not* need to define the same keyboard shortcuts in each
frame since the ancestor keeps the input focus and we've basically
dropped non-nested Wimp support. Maintaining no less than 4 lists of
identical shortcuts was a pain. Some Res files now only have the
lists in the main browser window and button bar objects (these two
are both required still).

Ursula build Markers button arrangement changed from 1x3 horizontal to
2x2 tilted, as in Phoenix, by popular demand.

Couple of hotlist bugs fixed; dragging an item and deleteing it with
Ctrl+X didn't terminate the drag, and deleteting an item underneath a
menu opened for it didn't close the menu.

'SendReferer' option added to all Choices files, all set to 'always'.
Put just beneath 'Clone' as it refers to header items, though really,
both Clone and SendReferer should probably be in the "Fetch controls"
section rather than "Multiuser environments and proxying"! Front-end
control of this is available.

In image_export_original, save_save_source, save_transfer_source and
save_save_object, flex_set_budge(0) was called to lock the heap but the
return value wasn't stored. flex_set_budge(1) was then used to unlock
the heap. All calls now remember and restore the old value, which is
both safer in case one calls another and allows the flex_set_budge
call in Main.c to have an application-wide meaning, as intended.

Some restructuring to the data load and RAM transfer sections of
Protocols.c; remote hotlist builds wouldn't allow files to be loaded
to browser windows before, and can now drop URL, URI or text files to
the Open URL dialogue.

New option "MinimumFontSize", lets the 'size' attribute of the 'font'
element be overridden. Default value is 1, to allow the full range of
values for the attribute. Setting to 7, for example, would give font
size 7 text at all times. Another new option, "ToggleOnXOnly", to
make Toggle Size only extend the window vertically (with Ctrl then
being used to toggle to genuine full size, rather than vice versa).
All Choices files updated to hold both of these options; only the
first has front-end control available (see debug build Res file).

JavaScript Document object exists; frames array etc. working. Can now
just about use "http://www.acorn.com/~ahodgkin/jschain/" but it does
abort after a bit - problems with frames again, I suspect. Is is pretty
slow, too. Can now press Escape to terminate a script.

Main.c erroneously referred to Controls file entry "StopWebServe" as
"StopWebProxy". Fixed.

Keyboard shortcuts to raise SaveFile are now possible in a general sense;
the code before was in the ToBeShown handler and just checked for a parent
component of -1. It then assumed "save frame HTML source". Now there's the
savefile_raise_from_shortcut function, which together with the seven new
event codes in SaveFile.h allows saving of HTML source and frame location,
export of links, images, backgrounds and the page as text or draw, to all
be invoked by keyboard shortcuts. Some Res files have some of these defined.

In reformat_check_height, the first check to see if setpara should be set
references a field in tpLast without checking if it is NULL. Whilst the
'line > 0' check should mean that tpLast wasn't NULL anyway, a direct
call to the function from outside of the reformatter might have tripped
up on this - the check for tpLast != NULL is now made.

Adjust-click on close icon in window showing file: URL attempts to open
the parent Filer window.

Reformatter used to try and find a selectable token if keyboard control
was enabled in a really stupid place - could make reformatting become
very slow if no selectables were present, especially if the page had a
few tables on it. Preprocessor now does this (since it goes through all
of the tokens anyway), the reformatter just doing a last check to ensure
no frames have obscured the selectable and if so, it tries to move it.
Done in the reformatter as generating a line array implies the data really
is visible.

Ctrl+Tab URL completion now builds a full list of matches from the hotlist
and history and can cycle through them (Ctrl+Shift+Tab stepping backwards).

Will give a real error rather than just "Data Abort" if it goes wrong
now. Someone somewhere is setting bit 30 of the error which confused
the replacement signal handler. Flag bits are now masked off (as they
should've been to start with).

@Check-in of Browse v2.06; using very small log file to try and avoid
CVS crashing. Some of the Resources may well be out of date due to CVS
locks being in place after earlier server-end core dumps, which I can't
remove myself.

I'll try and check one file in at the end with the full change log so
people know what's happened (it's reached about 16K...) - I'll make
that the TaskObey file '!All' in the top level directory. So for the
full log, look for the changes on this file.
