@  Completion of v2.11 check-in of Phoenix (note that the application
  gets its reported version number and date from Messages, not the
  VersionNum file, which updates independently).
Detail:
  Various resources updated. New About stuff included. Modification to
  Hotlist.c to ask DragAnObject to *really* call it in USR mode; requires
  DragAnObject 0.09. New "RMTry" utility in Phoenix to help make finding
  up to date modules more friendly - works well in itself but slows down
  the loading time quite a bit; would be nice to find a better solution.
  This will do in the short term, as it's a definite improvement over
  the way the !Run files used to work.
Admin:
  Use of DragAnObject 0.09 fixes aborts when trying to drag items around
  in the hotlist.

# 06-Jun-1997 (BAL): Made generic for toolbox apps. Extracts app name
#                    from _TaskName tag and gets version number and date
#                    from Version tag.
#
# 26-Apr-2000 (ADH): Modified for "dd mmm yyyy" format rather than out
#                    dated "dd-mmm-yy".
#
# 26-Apr-2005 (ADH): Updated to work in modern build systems under gawk.

64-wide comments adopted throughout. All headers protected against multiple
inclusion. Use of <> for external headers rather than "". For libraries,
<libname/header.h> is used rather than relying on a complex include path,
where appropriate. Move towards using external URILib rather than the local
copy. Phoenix JavaScript build resources are the only up to date set
currently so don't try others; more work still required on Makefile (e.g.
getting the ROM build working, and internationalisation issues).
