@  Huge pile of changes bringing relatively ancient sources up to date.
Detail:
  This check-in includes Phoenix version 2.11 (26-Apr-2005); only the
  debug and JavaScript builds of Phoenix have been tested and resources
  will definitely be out of date for other versions. The various "!..."
  scripts have been updated to require a minimum of 2MB with no maximum
  limit for building, as CC 5.60 is quite RAM hungry.
Admin:
  Phoenix 2.11 JS builds OK, works reasonably well. Many outstanding
  issues of course, as this is a very outdated browser now.

Version 2.09. Tagged as 'Browse-2_09'

; Purpose: The original Customer browser sources
;          used RISC_OSLib heavily and some of
;          the functions used are handy to have
;          around. This source file contains
;          a variety of functions from RISC_OSLib
;          with modifications where necessary
;          both to fit into the browser more
;          naturally, and to function better
;          under C release 5.
