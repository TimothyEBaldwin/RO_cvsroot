1.1
log
@  PDF export, some major redraw structural changes, updated resources,
  new build system, extensive Makefile modifications, const/restrict
  additions, various bug fixes.
Detail:
  PDF export facility. SEE Docs.User FOR DETAILS (important!). Includes
  UI for headers/footers in Choices and option switch in Print dialogue
  box. Minor bug fixes include printing bullet points and, at long last,
  the "print dialogue box contents are not set up" problem. Redraw engine
  now based entirely on function pointers. Draw export routine replaces
  screen output functions with Draw output functions; PDF does similar.
  Coordinate scaling system in Scale.c/h to help. Makefile changes: Now
  supports a more consistent set of build variants and has minimal
  duplication of object and library lists. New build system: !Mk...
  script files removed, FrontEnd tool !MkBrowse replaces it. See !ReadMe
  (replacing old ReadMe) in root for details. Requires FrontEnd 1.29,
  HTMLLib 0.02 and ImageLib 0.04 (by CVS VersionNum). Updated resources:
  Some attempt to bring all variants to a working level, but not much
  testing. Only the Phoenix JavaScript capable builds (Unicode or normal)
  are fully up to date, though, including PDF UI additions. Many other
  minor tweaks, and extensive use of const and restrict qualifiers
  propagated through source code in response to their use in the new
  redraw system.
Admin:
  Draw and PDF export tested quite heavily. Appears to work well. Text
  file 'Docs.User' describes limitations. Note required new module and
  library versions listed above. Note that only JavaScript capable
  Phoenix resources are updated and only Phoenix was heavily tested.

Version 2.12. Tagged as 'Browse-2_12'
