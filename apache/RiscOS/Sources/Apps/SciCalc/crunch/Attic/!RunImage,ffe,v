@Clipboard ownership fix
SciCalc would reply to clipboard requests even if someone else owned it, leading to the wrong thing being pasted depending on the order applications were running.
Fix submitted by Chris Wraight.
Makefile changed to use centralised BasCrunch script.

@Post submission tidy up calculator
* Removed the masks from '.' '0' and 'A'-'F' sprites (these are no longer needed as the black outline obscures the previously masked pixels).
* Makefile recreated from CApp shared makefile, now inserts version number into message at build time.
* Application name reverted to SciCalc, per the base licence terms this is a derivative of SciCalc (also restored original copyright attributions, and removed ROOL as the author).
* Wimpslot bumped up to account for the larger sprites are there are effectively two complete sets, one pressed and one not.
* A number of missing interactive help messages added, and corrections to the help provided with the new mode/base buttons. Typo 'chnges' fixed.
* Implemented a key pressed handler for the choices window. Previously key presses would be passed to the main calculator window - for example Escape would zero the display rather than dismiss the choices.
* Choices window no longer accepts the MENU mouse button for radio, option, and action buttons. Clicking ADJUST now keeps the window open for cancel/save.
* Removed a 'MOVS pc, r14' should be harmless in user mode, but not necessary as the preceding instructions can't set V anyway. The ROR and ROL could equally be implemented in BASIC.
* Comment in choices file swapped to '#' to match other (non obey file) choices.
* Fix for help on the base and mode menus - 2 undefined variables, presumably from an earlier version.
* Optional themed key top sprites now searched for using central Wimp$IconTheme - previous implementation had confused obey file EVAL syntax with string comparison
Tested new functionality and general robustness, did a few calculations, ROR and ROL checked.
