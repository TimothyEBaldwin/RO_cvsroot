@Post submission tidy up calculator
* Removed the masks from '.' '0' and 'A'-'F' sprites (these are no longer needed as the black outline obscures the previously masked pixels).
* Makefile recreated from CApp shared makefile, now inserts version number into message at build time.
* Application name reverted to SciCalc, per the base licence terms this is a derivative of SciCalc (also restored original copyright attributions, and removed ROOL as the author).
* Wimpslot bumped up to account for the larger sprites are there are effectively two complete sets, one pressed and one not.
* A number of missing interactive help messages added, and corrections to the help provided with the new mode/base buttons. Typo 'chnges' fixed.
* Implemented a key pressed handler for the choices window. Previously key presses would be passed to the main calculator window - for example Escape would zero the display rather than dismiss the choices.
* Choices window no longer accepts the MENU mouse button for radio, option, and action buttons. Clicking ADJUST now keeps the window open for cancel/save.
* Removed a 'MOVS pc, r14' should be harmless in user mode, but not necessary as the preceding instructions can't set V anyway. The ROR and ROL could equally be implemented in BASIC.
* Comment in choices file swapped to '#' to match other (non obey file) choices.
* Fix for help on the base and mode menus - 2 undefined variables, presumably from an earlier version.
* Optional themed key top sprites now searched for using central Wimp$IconTheme - previous implementation had confused obey file EVAL syntax with string comparison
Tested new functionality and general robustness, did a few calculations, ROR and ROL checked.
