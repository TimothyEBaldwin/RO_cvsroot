@Handful of SciCalc fixes
Detail:
  Some functions would be executed multiple times as some of the buttons had Click/Drag enabled. Fixes problem reported https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/3630.
  Leading zero in negative numbers would propagate during calculations. Fixes problem reported https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/3614
  The MR function does not always display correctly. It needs to replace the summary bar text if a sum is complete, and it also needs to retain the number prefix if in a non-decimal base.
  Rounding errors creeping in in some circumstances caused by rogue @@% variables in the wrong places and with the wrong values. Fixes ticket #412.
  UI confusion with a non "sticky" option field in the choices dialogue, moved to the View menu instead. Fixes ticket #413.
  Help updated to reflect the changes described.
  Removed some unused Message translations.
Admin:
  Submission from Chris Wraight.

@Restore some lost 3.10 compatibility
A handful of trivial mistakes stopped this working properly on RISC OS 3.10 as it always used to.
Messages:
 Correct the justification of Copy value/Copy summary for the system font (the Wimp right justifies when in outline font).
!Runimage:
 Change the redraw rectangle to cover the summary line as well as the result line, otherwise the rubout goes wrong on Wimp 3.16. This is harmless on later Wimps as it just results in a duplicate redraw rectangle when the summary icon is updated.
 Calculate the maximum menu width in system font units rather than just using 80 all the time.
 Change PROCwimp_additem to create indirected icons for text longer than 12 letters, so all the entries use that PROC so the width is calculated properly (indirected icons were written out longhand before).
Tested on an A5000.

@Add button set for Raspberry theme
Submission from Chris Wraight:
* Button sprites to match Steel window furniture in Raspberry theme
* Missing 'NEXT' statement added (line 191)
* Make some more of the button redraw conditional to reduce flicker
* Pop back in the trig mode/base buttons if selected with the adjust mouse button
* Dead functions grey/ungreyicon deleted
And other minor changes:
* Add support for squashed sprite files now the buttons are a bit bloaty
* Add ellipsis to the "Help..." iconbar menu item
* Program info box resized to match other built in apps
* Recovered 8bpp paletted sprites for the default theme, although the 16bpp ones are smaller, the Wimp can't fade those in the case of a calculation error - but as they can now be squashed the space saving is moot

@Fix for incorrect results when decimal separator isn't a period

* SciCalc uses a comma (or other local decimal separator) in some locales, as defined by Territory_ReadSymbols. This was being used in calculations as well as the display strings, leading to errors. @@% is now defined locally in PROCcalc_evaluate and PROCwimp_init.
* Previous versions used OS_Heap to allocate space for loading templates. This has been replaced by a DIM, and three functions have been removed.
* SciCalc-0_77 made some changes to the Interactive Help handling. This introduced two glitches: the help text returned for the Iconbar menu entries was incorrect, and the divider in the main menu was returning help text. Minor alterations to the Messages file and PROCwimp_gethelp to fix.

Fixes ticket #326. Changes from Chris Wraight.

@Save some space
Regenerate the button sprites as 16bpp, due to the small button size it's actually smaller than a paletted 8bpp one.
Drop the WimpSlot back down a bit.
Abbreviate some message tokens, using comments in the source code (which get stripped anyway).
Fix makefile to clean intermediate properly.
Rename percent button to not use '%' symbol so the sprites can be extracted as valid RISC OS filenames.

@Post submission tidy up calculator
* Removed the masks from '.' '0' and 'A'-'F' sprites (these are no longer needed as the black outline obscures the previously masked pixels).
* Makefile recreated from CApp shared makefile, now inserts version number into message at build time.
* Application name reverted to SciCalc, per the base licence terms this is a derivative of SciCalc (also restored original copyright attributions, and removed ROOL as the author).
* Wimpslot bumped up to account for the larger sprites are there are effectively two complete sets, one pressed and one not.
* A number of missing interactive help messages added, and corrections to the help provided with the new mode/base buttons. Typo 'chnges' fixed.
* Implemented a key pressed handler for the choices window. Previously key presses would be passed to the main calculator window - for example Escape would zero the display rather than dismiss the choices.
* Choices window no longer accepts the MENU mouse button for radio, option, and action buttons. Clicking ADJUST now keeps the window open for cancel/save.
* Removed a 'MOVS pc, r14' should be harmless in user mode, but not necessary as the preceding instructions can't set V anyway. The ROR and ROL could equally be implemented in BASIC.
* Comment in choices file swapped to '#' to match other (non obey file) choices.
* Fix for help on the base and mode menus - 2 undefined variables, presumably from an earlier version.
* Optional themed key top sprites now searched for using central Wimp$IconTheme - previous implementation had confused obey file EVAL syntax with string comparison
Tested new functionality and general robustness, did a few calculations, ROR and ROL checked.
