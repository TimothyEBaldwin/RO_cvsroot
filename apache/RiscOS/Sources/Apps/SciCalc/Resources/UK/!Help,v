@                        !SciCalc
                        ========

SciCalc is a scientific calculator which offers 4
numeric bases, 3 trigonometric modes, a memory
and a single level of brackets. Input can be
performed using the mouse and the keyboard, and
intermediate calculation steps are shown in its
summary bar.

Contents
========

1. System requirements
2. Basic operation
3. Advanced functions
4. Key shortcuts
5. Choices
6. Technical details


1. System requirements
======================

SciCalc requires the following resources, which should be located in the !System directory.

FPEmulator, 3.40 or later.
BASIC64 (BBC BASIC VI), 1.05 or later.


2. Basic operation
==================

Once loaded, clicking on the application icon in the iconbar will open the main calculator window. By default, this will be in 'Standard' view. You can toggle between this view and the 'Scientific' view by clicking on the Toggle icon in the window's Title Bar, or by clicking [Menu] over the calculator window and selecting 'View > Standard' or 'View > Scientific' from the main menu. You can also press [Ctrl]+[S] to toggle views.

The display field at the top of the window contains the most recently entered number or result. Any errors (such as 'Division by zero') are displayed here too. To clear an error, use the [C] button. Clicking in the calculator window will give the application the input focus, allowing you to type values into the calculator rather than use the mouse.

When in the Scientific view, you can change the numeric base and the trigonometric mode from popup menus. Changing between bases results in the number in the display field being converted. Note that changing from a decimal to a non-decimal base will round the currently displayed value to the nearest integer, but has no effect on previous parts of the current calculation. Rounding also occurs on numbers being recalled from memory in non-decimal bases.

The result in the display field can be copied to the global clipboard by selecting 'Edit > Copy' from the main menu. The summary bar can be copied to the clipboard by selecting 'Edit > Copy Summary'.

Further help on individual functions can be found by running the Help application from your Apps directory, and hovering the mouse over the button you need information on.

User choices can be set from the 'Choices' entry in the iconbar menu. The 'Quit' entry on the iconbar menu quits the application in the normal way.


3. Advanced functions
=====================

Trigonometric functions
-----------------------

SciCalc offers tangent [TAN], cosine [COS], sine [SIN], arctan [ATN], arccos [ACS] and arcsin [ASN] functions. Enter a digit into the calculator display, then click on a trigometric function button to give the result. The main display will show the result, while the Summary Bar will display the function name. To use Hyperbolic functions, click the [HYP] button before clicking the required trigonometric function button.


Percentages
-----------

The percentage button can be used in two ways. To find 15% of 47.3, enter [15], followed by the [%] button, then multiply the result by 47.3. To add 15% of 47.3 to itself, simply enter 47.3 + 15 followed by the [%] button. The main display will show the result, and the Summary Bar will resord the percentage.


4. Key shortcuts
================

The following table lists the calculator functions, together with key shortcuts where available.

4. Choices
==========

Open the Choices window by clicking 'Choices' from the iconbar menu.

You can choose which view the calculator window will default to from the 'Start-up settings' section. If you opt to start in Scientific view, you can also specify base and trigonometric settings.

In the 'Appearance' section, if you choose 'Use current desktop settings' then SciCalc will make use of any alternative themes you may have installed for your desktop. If you prefer to keep the default set of graphics for the main window, select 'Use application defaults'. Select 'Open calculator on start-up' to automatically open the calculator window when you run the application.

To save your changes, click [Save] or press [Enter]. The changes will only take effect next time you start the application.

From the main calculator window's menu, you can also opt to have the SciCalc window open at the same location when the application next starts. Click on 'View > Remember position'.

@Handful of SciCalc fixes
Detail:
  Some functions would be executed multiple times as some of the buttons had Click/Drag enabled. Fixes problem reported https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/3630.
  Leading zero in negative numbers would propagate during calculations. Fixes problem reported https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/3614
  The MR function does not always display correctly. It needs to replace the summary bar text if a sum is complete, and it also needs to retain the number prefix if in a non-decimal base.
  Rounding errors creeping in in some circumstances caused by rogue @@% variables in the wrong places and with the wrong values. Fixes ticket #412.
  UI confusion with a non "sticky" option field in the choices dialogue, moved to the View menu instead. Fixes ticket #413.
  Help updated to reflect the changes described.
  Removed some unused Message translations.

@Post submission tidy up calculator
* Removed the masks from '.' '0' and 'A'-'F' sprites (these are no longer needed as the black outline obscures the previously masked pixels).
* Makefile recreated from CApp shared makefile, now inserts version number into message at build time.
* Application name reverted to SciCalc, per the base licence terms this is a derivative of SciCalc (also restored original copyright attributions, and removed ROOL as the author).
* Wimpslot bumped up to account for the larger sprites are there are effectively two complete sets, one pressed and one not.
* A number of missing interactive help messages added, and corrections to the help provided with the new mode/base buttons. Typo 'chnges' fixed.
* Implemented a key pressed handler for the choices window. Previously key presses would be passed to the main calculator window - for example Escape would zero the display rather than dismiss the choices.
* Choices window no longer accepts the MENU mouse button for radio, option, and action buttons. Clicking ADJUST now keeps the window open for cancel/save.
* Removed a 'MOVS pc, r14' should be harmless in user mode, but not necessary as the preceding instructions can't set V anyway. The ROR and ROL could equally be implemented in BASIC.
* Comment in choices file swapped to '#' to match other (non obey file) choices.
* Fix for help on the base and mode menus - 2 undefined variables, presumably from an earlier version.
* Optional themed key top sprites now searched for using central Wimp$IconTheme - previous implementation had confused obey file EVAL syntax with string comparison
Tested new functionality and general robustness, did a few calculations, ROR and ROL checked.

  47.3 + 15 % =                      to 47.3 add 15% of itself

  15 % * 47.3 =                      find 15% of 47.3

Operator precedence:
-------------------

Operators are evaluated in the following order of precedence
(highest shown first).

  unary operators
  y€x
  xY
  nCr, nPr
  *, /, DIV, MOD
  +, -
  <O, O>, <<, >>, <<<, >>>
  AND, NAND
  OR, EOR, NOR, EQV

The SciCalc window
d30 11
a40 17
The title bar indicates the current base and, for decimal, the current
trigonometric mode.  The SELECT and ADJUST buttons applied to the "Base"
and "Mode" keys cycle through the bases and modes in opposite directions.

The numeric display contains the most recently entered number or result.
Any errors, for example "Division by zero", are displayed here too.
To clear an error, use the "C" button.

Clicking in the numeric display turns the title bar a cream colour,
indicating that numbers and selected operators may be entered from
the keyboard.  When the title bar is grey, the keyboard does not affect
the state of SciCalc.

Note that changing from decimal to a non-decimal base will round the 
currently displayed value to the nearest integer, but has no effect on 
previous parts of the current calculation.  Rounding also occurs on numbers 
being recalled from memory in non-decimal bases.

Double-clicking on the !SciCalc icon in a directory viewer installs SciCalc
on the icon bar.  Clicking on this icon with SELECT or ADJUST opens the
calculator window.
d66 52
a117 3
You can optionally cause the window to be opened at a chosen place on the
screen when SciCalc is run, by setting the system variable SciCalc$Window,
for example:
d119 1
a119 1
*Set SciCalc$Window 700,900
a120 2
The numbers are the x and y graphics coordinates for the bottom-left corner
of the displayed window.
d122 12
a133 2
You can also choose a particular base and trigonometric mode in which SciCalc
is to start, by setting SciCalc$Options, for example:
a134 1
*Set SciCalc$Options 2,1
d136 2
a137 1
The first number specifies the base, the second the mode. Allowed values are:
d139 5
a143 4
  Base - 1  Decimal
         2  Binary
         3  Octal
         4  Hexadecimal
a144 3
  Mode - 1  Radians
         2  Degrees
         3  Gradians
d146 2
a147 3
The above example sets the base to binary and the trigonometric mode (used 
when you next change to decimal base) to radians.  The default values are 
1,2 i.e. decimal and degrees.

Quitting from SciCalc
---------------------
d151 9
a159 5
You can quit completely from Scicalc by clicking MENU on the icon and
selecting Quit.  Alternatively, to remove the calculator window temporarily,
click on the window's close box.  Subsequently clicking on the icon will
re-open the window in the same position, with the calculation state 
preserved.
