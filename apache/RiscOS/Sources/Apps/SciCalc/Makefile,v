@Clipboard ownership fix
SciCalc would reply to clipboard requests even if someone else owned it, leading to the wrong thing being pasted depending on the order applications were running.
Fix submitted by Chris Wraight.
Makefile changed to use centralised BasCrunch script.

@Add button set for Raspberry theme
Submission from Chris Wraight:
* Button sprites to match Steel window furniture in Raspberry theme
* Missing 'NEXT' statement added (line 191)
* Make some more of the button redraw conditional to reduce flicker
* Pop back in the trig mode/base buttons if selected with the adjust mouse button
* Dead functions grey/ungreyicon deleted
And other minor changes:
* Add support for squashed sprite files now the buttons are a bit bloaty
* Add ellipsis to the "Help..." iconbar menu item
* Program info box resized to match other built in apps
* Recovered 8bpp paletted sprites for the default theme, although the 16bpp ones are smaller, the Wimp can't fade those in the case of a calculation error - but as they can now be squashed the space saving is moot

@Addition of button sprites for Ursula and Morris4
Morris4 buttons scraped off a RISC OS 3 disc, missing sprites (for example the base buttons) created or renamed as required.
Ursula buttons generated from Draw file masters.
Code changes
 Icon show/hide code revisited to allow sprite sets to omit the 'p' suffixed versions (previously if these were missing then the button underneath would show through).
 Free any unused memory once the sprites are loaded
 Don't redraw when pressing the mode buttons but not actually changing mode (less flicker)
Templates and default sprites now use expon/exponp and exp/expp for e^x and Exp.

@Save some space
Regenerate the button sprites as 16bpp, due to the small button size it's actually smaller than a paletted 8bpp one.
Drop the WimpSlot back down a bit.
Abbreviate some message tokens, using comments in the source code (which get stripped anyway).
Fix makefile to clean intermediate properly.
Rename percent button to not use '%' symbol so the sprites can be extracted as valid RISC OS filenames.

@Post submission tidy up calculator
* Removed the masks from '.' '0' and 'A'-'F' sprites (these are no longer needed as the black outline obscures the previously masked pixels).
* Makefile recreated from CApp shared makefile, now inserts version number into message at build time.
* Application name reverted to SciCalc, per the base licence terms this is a derivative of SciCalc (also restored original copyright attributions, and removed ROOL as the author).
* Wimpslot bumped up to account for the larger sprites are there are effectively two complete sets, one pressed and one not.
* A number of missing interactive help messages added, and corrections to the help provided with the new mode/base buttons. Typo 'chnges' fixed.
* Implemented a key pressed handler for the choices window. Previously key presses would be passed to the main calculator window - for example Escape would zero the display rather than dismiss the choices.
* Choices window no longer accepts the MENU mouse button for radio, option, and action buttons. Clicking ADJUST now keeps the window open for cancel/save.
* Removed a 'MOVS pc, r14' should be harmless in user mode, but not necessary as the preceding instructions can't set V anyway. The ROR and ROL could equally be implemented in BASIC.
* Comment in choices file swapped to '#' to match other (non obey file) choices.
* Fix for help on the base and mode menus - 2 undefined variables, presumably from an earlier version.
* Optional themed key top sprites now searched for using central Wimp$IconTheme - previous implementation had confused obey file EVAL syntax with string comparison
Tested new functionality and general robustness, did a few calculations, ROR and ROL checked.

Detail:
  The build process will add a line to the Messages file which contains
