@  Many changes and improvements to Alarm.
Detail:
  Style guide issues:
  * Fixed window menus to open at x-64,y instead of x-64,y+32
  * Pressing return in dialogue boxes causes the default button to be pressed
  * Changed 'Setup...' to 'Choices...' on iconbar menu.
  * Dialogue windows now have a Cancel button rather than a wimp close box.
 
  Set Alarm window changes:
  * Window redesigned.
  * Old behaviour (which was broken in 2.75) of clicking on the "Repeating
  * Alarm" icon expanding the window, has been reinstated.
  * Year, date, hour and minute icons are now directly editable.
  * New icons show the difference between the current time and the alarm you
    are setting.
 
  Fixed broken messages file, added a warning to hopefully stop it happening
  again.
 
  When the 'code' file isn't present, an error is generated; unfortunately
  this was translated via MsgTrans (the problem being the messages file
  hadn't been opened yet). This has now been fixed.
 
  Iconbar icon now uses desktop font, and has a fixed position on the
  iconbar.
 
  The Alarm$Options settings are saved in <Choices$Write>.Boot.Predesk.Alarm,
  so the user defined format is preserved over resets.
 
  Extensions to the user definede format:
    ~AH Analogue hours display.
    ~AM Analogue minutes display.
    ~AS Analogue seconds display.
    ~IN Alternating ':'/'.' indicator previously used by HH:MM format.
 
    You can now include system variables in the string. Alarm provides
    <Alarm$Free> which is the current free memory in the computer.
 
  Error changes:
  * Message_DataOpen is acknowledged straight away. Which prevents the
    situation of an error occuring, the OS running another copy of Alarm
    and then generating the same error again.
  * Errors 108D4 and 108D5 are ignored, as recommended on PRM3-64
  * Error windows now use the extensions provided by RO3.5
 
  Choosing "Set clock..." from the iconbar menu, will run the !TimeSetup
  configure plug-in if available.
 
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC RO402, RiscPC RO606, Underemulation on RO311 + universal
  boot & nested window manager.
