log
@Addition of extra sample maestro file and minor admin
* ShostF7 is Fugue number 7 in A major from 24 Preludes and Fugues, opus 87 by Dmitri Shostakovich. Score entered by Richard Hallas, who provides it here in maestro format
* Makefile adjusted to insert build version and date into messages file automatically
* Sources reimported as text to allow easier diffing. For the full history, you'll need to look at "!RunImage,ffb" in the attic
Tested briefly, info box is now right, and tunes are still played.
