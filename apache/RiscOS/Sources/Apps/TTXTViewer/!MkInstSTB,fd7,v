1.1
log
@  Made the component build.
Detail:
  * The pevious commit of this component would not build or install
    because:

    a) the makefile did not create the 'o' directory and
    b) the makefile over-rode the install directory specified on the
       command line

  * The clean rule also has been fixed to wipe the 'o' directory.
  * The !RunImage file has been removed from the "Resources" directory,
    as this is built during the build process.

  * There is still a fault in that the !Run file checks for a version
    of the IPTeletext module which is newer than the latest one in
    cvs.
Admin:
  Builds this time.

  It would be nice if components were checked to see if they actuall
  build from clean and then work correctly once built /before/ they
  are checked into cvs.

Version 0.05. Tagged as 'TTXTViewer-0_05'
