1.2
log
@  Added support for setting the default language.
Detail:
  The URL scheme has a new parameter "language=<lang>" where <lang> is a
  three-letter ISO_639_language_code. This is used for the default language
  charset. Charsets specified in the stream will override this.

  The launcher BASIC program can now be extended to take any number of
  parameters, rather than the hard-wired one parameter.

  E.g. HREF="teletext:?page=102&language=spa" will launch the Teletext
  viewer will a default page of 102 and Spanish language.

  I've also tidied the directory structure of these sources a little by
  adding the 'Docs' directory.
Admin:
  Tested on STB.

Version 0.11. Tagged as 'TTXTViewer-0_11'

----------

Fasttext support added.
When leaving hold mode the last page fetch is restarted, forcing a
refresh of the page with the most recent version.

----------

Added index button.

28/10/2001
----------

Made page cache persistent over invocations so the current page
doesn't need to be refetched if you go to TV mode then straight
back to teletext mode. The current page will also continue to be
fetched and cached in the background so the most recent version
should be immediately available.

29/10/2001
----------

Workaround for problems in VDU teletext code. Box on codes are
ignored if not repeated twice.@
