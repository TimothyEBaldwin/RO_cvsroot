@  Added support for setting the default language.
Detail:
  The URL scheme has a new parameter "language=<lang>" where <lang> is a
  three-letter ISO_639_language_code. This is used for the default language
  charset. Charsets specified in the stream will override this.

  The launcher BASIC program can now be extended to take any number of
  parameters, rather than the hard-wired one parameter.

  E.g. HREF="teletext:?page=102&language=spa" will launch the Teletext
  viewer will a default page of 102 and Spanish language.

  I've also tidied the directory structure of these sources a little by
  adding the 'Docs' directory.
Admin:
  Tested on STB.

@** TTextAndSubs_On ("MTTextAndSubs_On", &55A00)

   Activate a teletext / subtitling service session.

     +20 = Flags:
            Bit   Meaning if set
            Bits 0-7 =   reason code:
                         0: teletext magazine
                         1: DVB subtitles (anything referenced by
                            DVB subtitling descriptor, which can include
                            EBU Teletext subtitles)
            Bit 8 set => display windowed if set
            Bit 9 set => windowed display must overlay MPEG video, else
                         use the position at +28
            Bits 10-31 reserved (currently set to zero).

     +24 = Video Control client handle for related data stream.

     +28 = If bit 8 of the flags is set, bounding box for
           the display; OS units, (0,0) bottom left, order xmin,
           ymin, xmax, ymax.

     +44 = ISO_639_language_code eg "eng", "fre", "swe"
           Encoded within the word as a three-character null-terminated string

If flags bits 0-7 = 0 (teletext magazine)

+48: 0 => use page most recently displayed since stream was reset (ie since
          channel change) - this way, you can toggle TV/Mix/Text without
          losing your current page - or if teletext has not yet been viewed,
          then use default page carried in packet 8/30 in the stream
     1 => use page number specified in descriptor alongside teletext_type
          specified in +52, or if the descriptor is absent or didn't include
          that teletext_type, then use packet 8/30
     2 => use page number specified in +52
     other values reserved

     Note that in case 2, since the page number is not determined from a
     teletext descriptor, and the ISO_639_language_code at +44 is not
     sufficient on its own to select between multiple teletext streams
     associated with the same program, the ISO_639_language_code is ignored
     and the first teletext stream in the PMT is used. This is unlikely to be
     a problem in practice, as multiple language support is usually provided
     within a single teletext stream. In case 0, the teletext stream is
     implicitly the same as on the last call; if there was no previous call,
     then as with case 2, the first stream in the PMT is used; either way
     the ISO_639_language_code is irrelevant.

+52: unused if +48 = 0
     teletext_type if +48 = 1
     page number if +48 = 2     NB this is the hexadecimal (BCD) number

If flags bits 0-7 = 1 (subtitles)

+48: subtitling type (related to subtitling_type in the DVB subtitling
     descriptor)
        values currently defined are:
        0 = EBU Teletext subtitles
        1 = DVB subtitles (normal)
        2 = DVB subtitles (hard of hearing)

        This does not map directly to the subtitling_type in the
        subtitling descriptor, because where applicable, it is the viewer
        application's responsibility to choose between subtitling descriptors
        that only differ only in intended monitor aspect ratio.

   This message should be broadcast with event UserMessageRecorded.
   If it bounces, the controlling application should attempt to start
   the viewer by issuing:

   SYS "Wimp_StartTask","<TTXTViewer$Dir>"

   to start the teletext viewer, or:

   SYS "Wimp_StartTask","<DVBSubViewer$Dir>"

   to start the subtitle viewer. The TTextAndSubs_On message should
   then be resent. If it still bounces the service is unavailable.

   If a controlling application is to raise an error message, it
   must be aware that should the service have run single-tasking
   for a while and then crashed, the message would also bounce, so
   the wording of an error message should be appropriate for both
   events.

   The service acknowledges the message with MTTextAndSubs_OnAck.
   Services must not acknowledge messages with flag bits set that
   they do not understand. A service may wish to check that the
   data stream identified by the handle at offset 24 is one it can
   use, and acknowledge the message with an error if not.

   If a service runs single tasking (for example, for mode 7
   full screen display of normal teletext) it should acknowledge
   when it exits the single tasking session, not before entering
   it.

   The bounding box passed at offset 28 is there since whilst
   Video Control can be asked for the rectangle in which video is
   playing, this may not related to the rectangle for display. In
   full screen modes, services should use the Safe Area to
   determine what regions of the screen may be used, at least, if
   there is any ability to choose where things are placed.



** TTextAndSubs_OnAck ("MTTextAndSubs_OnAck", &55A01)

   Accept a request to start a teletext / subtitling session.

     +20 = Flags:
           Bit   Meaning
           0     If set then the viewer is running but the service
                 is unavailable for some other reason (eg, no video
                 stream is playing)
           1     If set, the service has run, completed, and
                 exited cleanly. If clear, the service has started
                 and is running normally, and must be shut down in
                 future.
           1-31  Reserved (set to zero).

     +24 = Video Control client handle for related data stream
           (preserved from MTTextAndSubs_On).

     +28 = If bit 0 of the flags is set then, error number

     +32 = If bit 0 of the flags is set then, error message

   A service sends this message to a controlling application to
   acknowledge receipt of MTTextAndSubs_On. There are three states
   which the service may be in:

   1) The service is unavailable.

   2) It may have run a single-tasking full screen session (e.g.
      for mode 7 display of normal teletext) and the user has
      exited this normally by some defined action, e.g. a button
      press on an IR handset.

   3) It may be running multi-tasking (e.g. for DVB subtitles
      displayed in Wimp windows) and the controlling application
      must take steps to shut the service down in future.

   In the fist case, the controlling application should optionally
   report the error message at offset 28 and need take no further
   action.

   In the second case, the controlling application can note that
   the service is not running and need take no more action until
   it next wants to start the service again, in which case it
   sends MTTextAndSubs_On as before.

   In the third case, the controlling application must at some
   point in the future send MTTextAndSubs_Off to the service (not
   as a broadcast) in order to cleanly shut it down.

   Applications should ignore flags bits they do not understand.



** TTextAndSubs_Off ("MTTextAndSubs_Off", &55A02)

   Deactivate a teletext / subtitling service session.

     +20 = Flags (all bits currently reserved, must be zero).

     +24 = Video Control client handle for related data stream
           (as sent for MTTextAndSubs_On).

   This message is sent by a controlling application when it wants
   to shut down a session which according to a previously received
   MTTextAndSubs_OnAck, is still running. It should be sent
   Recorded and may be acknowledged with MTTextAndSubs_OffAck. If
   the message bounces, the controlling application must assume
   that the service crashed or otherwise exited abnormally (e.g.
   because video playback failed).

   In many systems, teletext and subtitles are activated and
   deactivated using the same IR handset button which acts as a
   toggle. If, then, the controlling application is expecting to
   turn a service off but sees the message bounce, it knows it is
   not running, and must thus:

   * If it knows how to restart a crashed service, check it is
     not already running (ask the Task Manager) and restart it;

   * Send MTTextAndSubs_On to the service.

   Obviously this is only the case if the service's running state
   is to be toggled by the controlling application.



** TTextAndSubs_OffAck ("MTTextAndSubs_OffAck", &55A03)

   Accept a request to stop a teletext / subtitling session.

     +20 = Flags (all bits currently reserved, must be zero).

     +24 = Video Control client handle for related data stream
           (preserved from MTTextAndSubs_Off).

   This message is sent in reply to MTTextAndSubs_Off. The
   recipient can update any internal state as required to reflect
   the stopped condition of the teletext / subtitling session, and
   prepare for the next time it wishes to (re)start the service.

@  Made the application less over-enthusiastic to acknowledge teletext launch
  messages that don't belong to it. Updated message spec to fix a few points
  of confusion, and put back in the DVB subtitling aspects that seem to have
  been edited out at some point.
Detail:
  * Message handler should ignore reserved flag bits in Message_TTextAndSubsOn
  * Added flag bit delegating positioning of windowed data to the viewer app -
    in these cases, positioning should be determined from the MPEG system
    (this communication would be needed anyway for DVB subtitles, to determine
    the aspect ratio of the window)
  * Removed line stating that ISO_639_language_code is ignored in the teletext
    case - it's very much needed when, in combination with teletext_type, you
    select teletext page according to a DVB teletext descriptor
  * Re-added subtitling type values for DVB subtitles
  * Changed rules for sending Message_TTextAndSubsOn - it should always be
    broadcast, because in a multi-stream world there may well be multiple
    tasks that are handling the protocol
Admin:
  Not tested, but only a one-line code change.
  Note that the application claims launch messages for teletext pages
  selected by teletext_type, but it can't do anything sensible with them
  because the current code has no support for parsing teletext descriptors.
  Until descriptor support is added, this is also incapable of being used
  simultaneously with a DVB subtitle decoder. Another thought: should it
  really be the launcher's responsibility to know which application to try
  to execute when the Message_TTextAbdSubsOn message bounces?
