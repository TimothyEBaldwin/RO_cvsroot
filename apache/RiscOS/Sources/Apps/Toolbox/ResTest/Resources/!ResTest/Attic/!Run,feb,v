@Makefile recreated from fragments
Unused Sprites file no longer installed.
Combined Standard+Messages into conventional Messages, with the version number inserted at build time.
Read/write choices through Choices: and <Choices$Write> rather than saving them inside the application directory (may be read only).
Unixify #include paths.
Fix for NULL pointer dereference on startup, due to out-by-1 error handling the command line arguments via argc.
Insert the app version into the Info box at run time so it's not perpetually version 0.72.
Choices dialogue OK button resized per Style Guide and made a little more space for 3D borders.

Tested on a high vectors version of Raspberry Pi, opening and randomly clicking round the Res files used within !Configure and its plugins.

Import of ResTest from SrcFiler.

Reliance on dodgy dynamic SWI veneer removed - now uses _swix.
Version number incremented to 0.72.
Header file structure rationalised and missing prototypes added.
!Run file fixed (missing escape chararacter on Wimp$Scrap error message).
Uses standard format Makefile.
