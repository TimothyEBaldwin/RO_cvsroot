1.2
log
@  Removed outdated local copy of WinEdit.
Detail:
  The ResEd build system uses WinEdit in a command line form to do some
  of its build work. It used to use a local 26-bit copy in Resources, but
  now uses the 32-bit neutral up to date version provided by the build
  system. The local copy is no longer needed; deleted.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix under prototype Batch Two build environment.
