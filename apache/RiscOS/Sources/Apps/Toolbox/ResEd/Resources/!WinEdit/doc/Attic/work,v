@  Removed outdated local copy of WinEdit.
Detail:
  The ResEd build system uses WinEdit in a command line form to do some
  of its build work. It used to use a local 26-bit copy in Resources, but
  now uses the 32-bit neutral up to date version provided by the build
  system. The local copy is no longer needed; deleted.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix under prototype Batch Two build environment.

@Work remaining on !ResEd   -*- Text -*-
------------------------

William,

As much as possible I have broken the remaining work down, and
indicated areas that could be dropped from the spec without too much
loss of functionality.  (Also the Align dialogue could be restructured
as a set of menu entries; this would save a day.)  I have tried to be
realistic in the assessment of times required.



Finish current set of changes - 2 days.
  Breakdown: specific alignment point on copy/move (0.5 day); align on copy
  (0.5 day); tweaks to the type-specific properties dialogues (1 day)

"Custom icon" properties dialogue: 2 days.

Baseline alignment points.  1 day - requires duplicating Wimp positioning calculations.

Align dialogue.  2 days.  [Could be omitted in initial release.]

Distribute dialogue.  2 days.  [Could be omitted in initial release.]

Menus, keyboard shortcuts and save-as.  3 days.

Safe exit / CloseDown.  1 day.

Implement palette of gadgets.  1 day for the palette template, 1 day of programming

Write interactive help messages (code already present): 0.5 day.

Write some explanatory notes to aid user.  1-2 days.

Tidy up templates - done at end because I'll have a working template editor to do it
with.  1-2 days, depending on level of fussiness.

Testing/tweaks/bugfixing time: 3-5 days.


[ Optional extras:-

Full support of single selection model.
Implement cut-and-paste (already got drag-n-drop).
Implement ghost caret for drag-n-drop.
Implement iconbar trash-can

Estimates for these available on request ]


Also:-
 Get return key and arrows to work in all dialogues
