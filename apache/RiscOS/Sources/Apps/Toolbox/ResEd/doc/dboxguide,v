@!ResEd Dialogue box layout guidelines
-------------------------------------

All boxes designed in Mode 27, then checked for alignment in
Mode 12.

!WinEdit grid set to 8 os units, and all gadgets in all dialogue
boxes are locked to this grid.

The heights of gadgets such as writables, option buttons etc. 
are all unchanged from the palette window - only the widths 
were changed.
The widths are assessed using System font, and then checked with
Homerton.Medium, at this stage extending icons where necessary.
All similar/functionally identical gadgets are the same size across
dialogue boxes.  (I.e. Once an event writable's size is established
this is used uniformly across all dialogue boxes).

The following is a list of various measurements in OS units:

Borders (Top, Bottom, Left & Right) -  16
OK/Cancel Buttons                   -  16 apart, bottom right corner
Frames                              -  8 space left above, 16 below
Borders within Frames               -  16 all around
Other Gadgets                       -  16 apart vertically
PopUp buttons                       -  8 to right of display horizontally
Adjuster arrows                     -  8 to right of field horizontally
Other Gadgets                       -  16 apart horizontally, or evenly
                                       spaced across dialogue box

Template editors
----------------

!WinEdit was used to create the Template files, and to edit them - although
some changes had to be made with FormEd and !TemplEd.

Sadly, some of the Templates files now fail to load into these latter two
editors, and - even if successful - may not save with all the validation
information required by !WinEdit: so beware!

To ensure that the dialogue boxes and buttons look satisfactory in all
"reasonable" modes, the sizes and positions must all be multiples of 4
OS units. It's easy to ensure that the size is correct using !WinEdit,
but not the position - so a program *templalign was developed to force
the bottom left-hand corner of every icon to be on a 4-pixel-aligned point.
This program is in the directory templalign inside the aquarius directory.
