@Capability to edit ToolAction gadgets properly added.  ResEd
understands both the old 60 byte ToolAction gadgets and the new 76 byte
versions.  It upgrades the older ones to the newer format when the
Window is first edited.
The Misc editor also knows how to edit new versions of the ProgInfo object
(the ones with web site buttons).
Altered version number and build date maintenance so it uses the
VersionNum file managed by srccommit instead of being hidden away in
the source structure.
!Run file error messages sanitised and made more consistent.
Makefile structure improved and static dependency information made at
least as strict as necessary to ensure correct rebuilds.
