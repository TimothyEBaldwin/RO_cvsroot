@Fix 5x NULL pointer dereferences
menu/props.c:
  A missing 'return' would cause the key handler to fall through to the end of the function and attempt to pass the caret to the dbox that was just closed (and set to NULL).
window/gadget.c:
  Quit if strloc is NULL, before dereferencing it to find if strloc is an empty string.
shell/document.c:
  An overly cunning for loop construction would cause a NULL pointer dereference every redraw attempt when there were no objects in the document. The termination statement needs to be evaluated (when doc->numresources is 0) before trying to access the doc->mapping member. Loops unjumbled.
misc/object.c:
  Recoded if/else to switch case for REF_STR and REF_MSG fix up, then just copied the same fix from window/gadget.c in the same place.
window/format.h:
  Added a note that WimpIconTemplate is actually referring to a Button gadget.
Resources/Window/Palette
  The button gadget in the gadget palette was incorrect - it specified a NULL pointer for the StringReference for the validation string option, but gave it a length of 1. Now zero.
window/gui.c
  Fallout from the duff button gadget is that all Res files created to date with an empty validation string would not be recognised as empty by gui_load_len_field() and attempt to strlen(NULL). To handle that, a NULL with a length of 0 or 1 is now considered empty, and will subsequently be saved out with a length of 0.

Tested by making a Res file with 1 of each object type, and randomly prodding round in all their dialogues, and a Window object with 1 of each gadget, and doing likewise.
