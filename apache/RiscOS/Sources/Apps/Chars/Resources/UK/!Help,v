@Add support for selecting from Unicode fonts
Detail:
  Changed !RunImage to support working with the Unicode Font Manager, and revised !Help.
  Replacement templates, and revised Messages for the extra menus and window layout.
  As this component also features in the disc image (RO350Hook) it also degrades on earlier Font Managers.
Admin:
  Submission from Chris Wraight.
  To get the code point names while hovering with the mouse, Unicode-0_35 should be updated for the CharNames table.

Version 2.00. Tagged as 'Chars-2_00'

                         ======

Chars is a character finder application. It can 
display all the defined characters in a font, as 
well as allowing characters to be entered into 
documents using the mouse pointer.

1. System requirements
======================

Chars requires RISC OS 3.1 or later. It will make use of the Unicode Font Manager if present.


2. Basic operation
==================

To start Chars, double-click on its icon. A window will appear showing all the characters currently available in the selected font. By default, Chars will start with the System font. You can select different fonts and encodings by choosing from the pop-up menus at the top of the window.

Some fonts have thousands of characters. When using the UTF8 encoding, you can choose to show only a subset of those characters. The Category menu offers a selection of common subsets, such as the Latin script, Symbols, etc. Selecting 'All' will display all the characters in the font.

To enter a character into an editor application, position the mouse pointer over it in the Chars window and click [Select] or press the [Shift] key. The character will be entered at the caret position as if it had been typed. Use of the [Shift] key is suggested if you are trying to enter text into a writeable icon inside a menu, as clicking [Select] will cause the menu to disappear.

Note that the operation of character entry differs depending on the encoding in use by the Desktop (the 'Alphabet') and by Chars. If a character cannot be inserted in the current Alphabet (e.g., because the UTF8 codepoint is too high for an 8-bit Alphabet), then the character will be greyed-out in the Chars window.

Depending on the encoding in use, some characters can also be inserted at the caret by holding down [Alt] and typing [character code] on the numeric keypad. Chars will display this keypress combination where it is available, together with information on the character number and name, at the bottom of the window.


3. Encodings
============

Chars is capable of displaying fonts in various different encodings. Historically, encodings have been used to allow 8-bit fonts, which have a maximum of 255 characters, to display characters from a range of different alphabets. The UTF8 encoding allows thousands of characters to be used.

The Desktop also makes use of encodings (Alphabets), which control how fonts used by the Window Manager are displayed. You can find the current Alphabet by typing the command '*Alphabet' at a command prompt. A list of available encodings is given by the command '*Alphabets'.

Most fonts can be sensibly displayed in the full range of encodings given by *Alphabets. One exception is the System font, which doesn't use the Font Manager. Others are 'symbol' fonts, such as Sidney and Selwyn. Symbol fonts use an internal encoding, which can be selected by choosing 'Default' from the encoding menu (only available in non-UTF8 Alphabets).

If you change the Alphabet while Chars is running (e.g., by issuing a new *Country or *Alphabet command), you must re-select the font from the font menu to update the display.


4. Key shortcuts
================

Pressing [Shift] when the mouse pointer is over the character map results in the character code being entered at the caret.


5. Choices
==========

Open the Choices window by clicking 'Choices' from the iconbar menu.

Select 'Open window at start-up' to automatically open the characters window when you run the application. You can choose to set the default font to the System Font or the crrent Desktop Font.

To save your changes, click [Save] or press [Return]. The changes will take effect next time you start the application.


6. Technical details
====================

Clicking on a character (or pressing [Shift] while the mouse pointer is over it) results in the character code being sent from Chars to the editor window with the caret in it. If the font's encoding in Chars is UTF8 then the character code may be more than one byte long, in which case the code is broken up into a stream of bytes that are sent in order to the receiving application.

If the encoding selected in Chars and the encoding used by the editor to display its text are different, then the displayed character may differ from what the user intended. The only way to be sure that the character sent from Chars will be the one displayed in the editor is to ensure that the same font and encoding are used in both applications.@

The Chars application helps you to enter characters
that are not available on the keyboard; for example
accented characters or special symbols.

To start Chars, double-click on its icon.  A window
will appear showing all the characters currently
available.

To enter a character, position the mouse pointer over
it and click SELECT (or press the SHIFT key).  The
character will be entered at the caret position as if
it had been typed.

Use of the SHIFT key is suggested if you are trying to
enter text into a writeable icon inside a menu, as
clicking SELECT will cause the menu to disappear.
