                        =========


Patience is a card game for a single player. Various options for dealing and 
style of play are available.


Contents
========

1. How to play
2. Key shortcuts
3. Choices


1. How to play
==============

Clicking on the app's icon opens the game window. The seven columns of cards 
are referred to as the table. The four cards in the top right are called the 
stack. The card back below the stack represents the undealt deck, and the 
exposed card next to it is the waste pile. The score of games won is displayed
in the top-left, the number of cards left to be dealt in the top-right.

The object of the game is to uncover all the cards on the table and drag them
to the stack. The stack is filled in ascending order from Ace to King.

Click on the deck to deal more cards to the waste pile. Dealt cards can be
dragged to the table. Each column on the table is arranged in descending value
from King to Ace in alternate suit colour. Cards can also be dragged from
column to column on the table in order to uncover more cards. The game
continues until no more cards can be uncovered or the stack is full.

If you get stuck, selecting 'Resign' from the main menu displays all the cards
on the table face-up. You can also click on the deck to cycle through the
cards remaining undealt.

Selecting 'New game' reshuffles the pack and starts again.

Clicking ADJUST on a suitable card in the table or the pile will send it
straight to the stack.

Clicking 'Remember position' from the main menu will keep the position and
size of the game window for the next session.


2. Key shortcuts
================

Esc    Resign the game
F2     Start a new game
F1     Show help


3. Choices
==========

If 'Only Kings start a new column' is selected, then only Kings can be dragged
to empty holes on the table. Deselecting this option allows any card to be
dragged to a hole, making the game much easier.

'Reverse deal' refers to the process by which cards are turned over from the
deck to the waste pile. The default is that cards, selected from the top of
the deck in groups of three, are order reversed  while being moved from the
deck to the pile. This results in 2/3 of the pack being visible by running
through it twice. The alternative is for no reversal, meaning that only 1/3 of
the deck is visible when running through it, making the game much harder.

You can choose to have cards dealt in threes, or singly (in which case
'Reverse deal' makes no difference).

Clicking 'Sound' will use a beep to indicate an illegal move.

This version of patience has the following features:
d5 2
a6 2
* when "Resign" has been activated, allows the cards
  in the pack to be stepped through one by one.
d8 66
a73 33
* "New Pack" allows picture on the card's back can 
  be changed: 4 pictures are provided (more can be 
  added by defining appropriate pictures in the
  sprites, sprites22 and sprites23 files).

* games can be won and a score of played versus won 
  is kept by the game.

* the status of the controls can be saved. The 
  !Config file records the back design, the state 
  of "Only Kings" and "Rev. Cards", plus the number
  of cards turned over at once.

There are two controls on the menu which affect how 
the game is played:

"Only Kings" refers to which cards are allowed to be
placed in empty places. The default is that only 
kings may be placed in a hole; when any card can be 
placed the game is dramatically easier.

"Rev. Cards" refers to the process by which cards 
are turned over from the pack to the waste pile. The
default is that cards, selected from the top of
the pack in groups of three, are order reversed 
while being moved from the pack to the waste pile - 
this results in 2/3 of the pack being visible by
running through it twice. The alternative is for no 
reversal - only 1/3 of the pack is visible when 
running through it:- the game gets much harder.
[the interested hacker can change the number of 
cards being moved: it's the last parameter in the 
!Config file.]
