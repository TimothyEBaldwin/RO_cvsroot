@                        The Diversions Directory
                        ------------------------


This directory is a collection of small applications and games which we
believe you would find useful and interesting. Although we don't expect you
to have any problems with these programs they have not gone through Acorn's
normal, thorough testing procedure and so are supplied 'as is'.
