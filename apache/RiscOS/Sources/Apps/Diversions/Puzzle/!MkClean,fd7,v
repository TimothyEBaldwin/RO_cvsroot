4.1
log
@Fix for menu opening position
Puzzle was opening at x-32,y+16 rather than x-64,y+0 like the Style Guide says.
Makefile recreated from fragments.
Readded missing licence heading.
Fixed the 'Ensure' utility, the logic for FNSpriteExists was backwards meaning it never got loaded on a machine which didn't have the sprite.
Built, and briefly tested.

Version 1.08. Tagged as 'Puzzle-1_08'
