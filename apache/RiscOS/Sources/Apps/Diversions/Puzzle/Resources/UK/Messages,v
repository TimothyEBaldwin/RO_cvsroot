@Consistency improvements
Rename dangerous looking "Reset" button to "Default" to match the !Configure plugins.
Change "Default" button behaviour such that only Select click does something (restore factory defaults) rather than confusing reload existing/restore factory with Select/Adjust.
Don't double translate the templates - previously PROClabelwindows would change all the text via the Messages file.
References to "View" window in the !Help changed to "Display" options window.

Spotted while updating User Guide chapter.
