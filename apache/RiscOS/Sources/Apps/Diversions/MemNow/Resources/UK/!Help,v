@  Fix iconbar icon, automatically update version number and minor tweaks.
Detail:
  Made icon slightly deeper (68 instead on 64), so it's the correct size and
  matches Alarm and Display Manager on the iconbar.
  Changed crunching stage to be consistent with other Basic programs.
  Changed !Help file to say MemNow instead of !MemNow.
  Automatically update version number in "About this program" window.
  Now sets the installed app's files to lr/r access attributes.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC RO4.02
Notes:
  Changes by James Lampard.

                            ======

MemNow displays the currently available free memory on the 
iconbar. The number displayed is in KBytes. When you get 
exceptionally short of memory the icon will start to flash 
to warn you of this.
