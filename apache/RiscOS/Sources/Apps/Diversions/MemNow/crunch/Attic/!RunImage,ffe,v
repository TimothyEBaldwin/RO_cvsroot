@Handle display of memory over 999MB properly
MemNow had some assumptions about the maximum memory it could show
* The icon width is now adapted at run time to be wide enough for the maximum amount of free memory
* Free memory >= 2GB would be displayed as a negative number
* The threshold of 16k meaning "panic flash" would trigger when in truth >= 2GB of free memory remained
Changes inspired by initial work from Raik Fischer, the number 2, and the letter G.
Makefile recreated from fragments.
Tested with a handful of hardcoded memory amounts on a Risc PC with RISC OS 4.02, in a Homerton desktop font.

@  Fix iconbar icon, automatically update version number and minor tweaks.
Detail:
  Made icon slightly deeper (68 instead on 64), so it's the correct size and
  matches Alarm and Display Manager on the iconbar.
  Changed crunching stage to be consistent with other Basic programs.
  Changed !Help file to say MemNow instead of !MemNow.
  Automatically update version number in "About this program" window.
  Now sets the installed app's files to lr/r access attributes.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscPC RO4.02

  Changes by James Lampard.
