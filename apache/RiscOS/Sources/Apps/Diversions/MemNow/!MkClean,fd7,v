@Handle display of memory over 999MB properly
MemNow had some assumptions about the maximum memory it could show
* The icon width is now adapted at run time to be wide enough for the maximum amount of free memory
* Free memory >= 2GB would be displayed as a negative number
* The threshold of 16k meaning "panic flash" would trigger when in truth >= 2GB of free memory remained
Changes inspired by initial work from Raik Fischer, the number 2, and the letter G.
Makefile recreated from fragments.
Tested with a handful of hardcoded memory amounts on a Risc PC with RISC OS 4.02, in a Homerton desktop font.

Version 0.07. Tagged as 'MemNow-0_07'
