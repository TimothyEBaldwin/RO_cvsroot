Flasher will increase productivity when using your
RISC OS machine to run any DeskTop program by making
the caret flash so that it may be located more quickly
by a single glance at the screen; studies in the past
have shown that a flashing cursor can increase the
speed of normal data entry by as much as 40%.

In cases where the caret can still not be located
(eg. it is behind another window), you can click
SELECT over the Flasher icon on the icon bar to find
it wherever it is (try it and see!).

While Flasher is running, you may click on its icon bar
icon to locate the caret. This will send a message to
the window containing the caret, asking it to scroll so
that the caret is in the centre of the window and jump
to the foreground. The pointer will then be positioned
over the caret. Note that some tasks are not correctly
written and will therefore not respond to this message
in a sensible fashion.

Note that the menu also allows you to turn flashing on
and off and also has a Find option; this locates the
caret in the same way as clicking on the iconbar icon.
If the caret is not currently displayed, the Find option
will be shaded out and the iconbar icon will yield a bleep.

      How to use the Minerva Software Text Reader
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*>Help
This text reader has been written for easy browsing  of
Minerva  help  files.  To  use it, you can click on the
icons to the right.  The ‹ and Š icons  will  move  you
through the text one page at a time. The ‰ icons select
'index points' and  any which have text beside them may
be clicked to jump directly to the indicated page.

The text may be printed out by clicking  on  the  PRINT
icon.  While printing takes place, you may interrupt it
by pressing [ESCAPE].

When you have finished with the  Text  Reader  utility,
click the „ icon to close the window and exit.

About Flasher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*>Flasher
Flasher will  increase  productivity  when  using  your
Archimedes  to  run  any  DeskTop program by making the
caret flash so that it can be located more quickly by a
single glance at the screen; studies in the  past  have
shown  that a flashing cursor can increase the speed of
normal data entry by as much as 40%. In cases where the
caret can still  not  be  located  (eg.  it  is  behind

that  the caret is in the centre of the window and jump

over  the caret. Note that some tasks are not correctly
written and will therefore not respond to this  message
in a sensible fashion. In this case (eg. 1stWord+), you
should  click  MENU on flasher and disable Scroll. Note
that the menu also allows you to turn flashing  on  and
off  and also has a Find option; this locates the caret
in the same way as clicking on the iconbar icon. If the
caret is not currently displayed, the Find option  will
be shaded out and the iconbar icon will yield a bleep.
