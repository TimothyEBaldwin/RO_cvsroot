@  Import of SrcEdit 1.23.
Detail:
  Appears to be substantially more complete than the version previously
  imported. Thanks to Rob Sprowson for bringing this to our attention.
Admin:
  Builds, and tested briefly - seems to fix the more obvious bugs that were
  present in the previous version.

Version 1.23. Tagged as 'SrcEdit-1_23'

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of !SrcEdit, exported from the old SrcFiler repository
  and given a modern build structure.
Detail:
  I'm not convinced these are actually the most recent sources. They didn't
  build as-is against a "modern" RISC_OSLib, and I had to substitute the
  !Run/!Boot/Messages etc from the C/C++ tools release to make it work.
  There are still some issues - some menus are incorrectly created, and one
  source file invokes a compiler bug.
Admin:
  Not particularly thoroughly tested.
