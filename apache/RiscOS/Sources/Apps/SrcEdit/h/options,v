@ BASIC editing added so that you can replace !Edit

Detail:
 Changes from Colin Granville:
 * BASIC editing added.
 * BASIC options added and saved with other options.
       s       indicates don't strip line numbers.
       n<num>  sets line number increment to num.
 * Added 'Export' file to !Run which sets SrcEdit$Detokenise and
   SrcEdit$Tokenise for BASIC editing.
 * Added creation of BASIC files, TaskObey files and creation by
   name entries on the Create Menu.
 * Changed sprites to RO5 sprites - versions which came with the Acornc/c++
   distribution.
 * Options read from Choices:SrcEdit
 * Options written to <choices$Write>.srcedit.
 * Read-only documents can be printed.
 * Read-only documents can have selections saved and printed.
 * ctrl A selects whole text (should be done by RiscOSLib).
 * version now set by EditId in Messages file - was from templates file.

Admin:
 Tested on Iyonix RO510

@  Import of SrcEdit 1.23.
Detail:
  Appears to be substantially more complete than the version previously
  imported. Thanks to Rob Sprowson for bringing this to our attention.
Admin:
  Builds, and tested briefly - seems to fix the more obvious bugs that were
  present in the previous version.

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of !SrcEdit, exported from the old SrcFiler repository
  and given a modern build structure.
Detail:
  I'm not convinced these are actually the most recent sources. They didn't
  build as-is against a "modern" RISC_OSLib, and I had to substitute the
  !Run/!Boot/Messages etc from the C/C++ tools release to make it work.
  There are still some issues - some menus are incorrectly created, and one
  source file invokes a compiler bug.
Admin:
  Not particularly thoroughly tested.
