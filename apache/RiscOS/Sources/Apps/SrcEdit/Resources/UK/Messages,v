@Switch from ArcEdit style model to clipboard cut & paste model
Messages:
 Remove TaskInput from Task menu, add clipboard keys to Select menu, add swap case to Select menu.
 Slim down the Misc menu which was too wide in system font.
 Update interactive help.
 Use some more of the escape code tokens in interactive help.
 Remove key shortcut from iconbar menu.
Templates:
 Line use magic search character '\n' in the dialogue.
message.c:
 Let the task window accept clipboard pastes too.
 This is tied to the 'Ignore ctrl' menu option. When enabled (default) then ^C ^V are filtered out to for clipboard typing to the task, and filters control characters from the task too (as before). When disabled, ^C ^V are passed raw to the task, and all VDU is displayed raw from the task. Cut & paste can still be performed in the disabled case by using the Edit->Select menu.
multiedit.c:
 Adjust list of acceptable keys in Read-Only mode.
 Remove nonsense shortcut keys.
 Inform RISC_OSLib of a read only text using new charoption txt_READONLY.
srcedmenus.c:
 Adjust shading logic for changed menu layouts.
winevent.c:
 Remove handling of ^A, as this is now dealt with in txt.

@Extra help for languages
ASM:
This help reference didn't even contain MUL and MLA, dating it to somewhere around ARMv2. Add opcodes at least up to ARMv5 so we're in the 21st century from the ARM ARM.
C:
Corrections, plus added the extra headers and functions from C99 with assistance from Colin Granville on the new headers.
References to obsolete ANSI specs and Arthur/Brazil (!) brought up to date.
Messages:
Removed excess space before (Read-only) in title bar, changed 'BASIC file' to 'BASIC' in the create new file menu to match !Edit, bumped version.

@Eliminate need for EditIntern headers
main.c:
New function save_one_txt() removes the need to reach into the internals of RISC_OSLib for a single use of txtfile_saverange().

message.c:
Use renamed task window header.

@ BASIC editing added so that you can replace !Edit

Detail:
 Changes from Colin Granville:
 * BASIC editing added.
 * BASIC options added and saved with other options.
       s       indicates don't strip line numbers.
       n<num>  sets line number increment to num.
 * Added 'Export' file to !Run which sets SrcEdit$Detokenise and
   SrcEdit$Tokenise for BASIC editing.
 * Added creation of BASIC files, TaskObey files and creation by
   name entries on the Create Menu.
 * Changed sprites to RO5 sprites - versions which came with the Acornc/c++
   distribution.
 * Options read from Choices:SrcEdit
 * Options written to <choices$Write>.srcedit.
 * Read-only documents can be printed.
 * Read-only documents can have selections saved and printed.
 * ctrl A selects whole text (should be done by RiscOSLib).
 * version now set by EditId in Messages file - was from templates file.

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of !SrcEdit, exported from the old SrcFiler repository
  and given a modern build structure.
Detail:
  I'm not convinced these are actually the most recent sources. They didn't
  build as-is against a "modern" RISC_OSLib, and I had to substitute the
  !Run/!Boot/Messages etc from the C/C++ tools release to make it work.
  There are still some issues - some menus are incorrectly created, and one
  source file invokes a compiler bug.
Admin:
  Not particularly thoroughly tested.
