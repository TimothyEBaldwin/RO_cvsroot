@  Automatically update version number in CloseUp's program info window.
Detail:
  All the fields in the "About this program" window are read from the
  messages file.
  Using the new AWK script, the version token in the messages file is
  automatically read during building.
  Fixed spelling of "occurred" in messages file.

  Application task name is now "CloseUp" rather than "CloseUp Utility"
  In !Help and Messages files: In several places removed ! from !CloseUp,
  because the directory is named !CloseUp; the application is called CloseUp.

  Tested on RiscPC RO402

@Fix error handler of CloseUp.
Detail:
  The error handler calls FNmessone, unfortunately the routine's name has
  been changed to FNmessageone. This error in the error handler was causing
  an infinite loop. The error handler could also be called before the wimp
  was initialised - which would also cause an infinite loop. So I've reviewed
  all the error handling code to make it more robust.
 
  The menus were being opened at x-96 when it should be x-64. This has been
  fixed.
 
  Key-cursor has been fixed to work the same as in the RO Select version of
  CloseUp.
