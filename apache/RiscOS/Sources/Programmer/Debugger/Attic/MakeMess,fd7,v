4.5
log
@    Header exports now work.

Detail:
    Build would not build with this version of the module as the last change
to the makefile did not include the line needed to export the Debugger
header. This line has now been added.
    Added an !MkExport to enable testing of the export.
    Converted the existing Mk... obey files to !Mk... files.

Admin:
    Some basic testing.

log
@  * Added a couple of tweaks to the MakeMess and MkClean files.
  * Added the Disassemble$Options system variable.
Detail:
  * MakeMess now does a CDir command (in case you run it before
    running MkRom). MkClean now includes a 'stripdepnd' call.

  * There is a new system (code) variable created on module init
    called Disassemble$Options. This controls (at the moment)
    register naming for disassembly.
Admin:
  Tested on RiscOS 4 and 3.70.

log
@* Disassembly of VFP instruction set added.
* Changed invalid instruction to &E7FFFFFF (as per ARM
  recommendation that &E7FxxxFx should be used)
* Branch disassembly changed - when running on a
  26-bit systems, branch instructions in the lower
  64M will be wrapped within 64M, but branches
  above 64M will not.
* PC-relative LDRH family instructions calculated
  target address incorrectly.
