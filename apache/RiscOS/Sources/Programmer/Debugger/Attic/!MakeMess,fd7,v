4.2
log
@  Now has a standalone build variant
Detail:
  Debugger now handles registering and deregistering its messages file with
  ResourceFS when you build a RAM (standalone) variant. This obsoletes the
  DbgMess module.
Admin:
  Tested briefly

4.1
log
@    Header exports now work.

Detail:
    Build would not build with this version of the module as the last change
to the makefile did not include the line needed to export the Debugger
header. This line has now been added.
    Added an !MkExport to enable testing of the export.
    Converted the existing Mk... obey files to !Mk... files.

Admin:
    Some basic testing.
