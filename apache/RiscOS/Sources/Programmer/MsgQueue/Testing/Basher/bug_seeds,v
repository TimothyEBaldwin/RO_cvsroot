1.2
log
@Fixes a bug where strange desktop errors were happening after between 5
and 10,000 (test prog) basher iterations.  In cases where a message wrapped
round the tail, and, 20 bytes of the message were at the tail, insertion of
the timestamp caused 4 bytes of data corruption.  This was down to writing
less than or equals, rather than just a less than.

Added code to check for data corruption beyond the tail.  With this enabled,
and the bug above fixed, I've seen no more overwrites.
