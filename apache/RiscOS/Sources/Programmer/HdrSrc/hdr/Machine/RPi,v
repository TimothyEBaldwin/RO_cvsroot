@  Add Raspberry Pi 2 support
Detail:
  The Raspberry Pi ROM now joins the IOMD ROM in supporting multiple
  architectures, in this case ARMv6 and ARMv7. This has been achieved by
  creating a new machine type specific for Raspberry Pi. The old ARM11ZF
  machine type remains for builds that are ARM11-only.

  The Raspberry Pi 2 uses the Cortex-A7 processor, which includes version 4
  of the VFP instruction set and version 2 of the Advanced SIMD (NEON)
  instruction set. You can now switch on this at assembly time using the new
  switches NoARMVv4 and SupportARMVv4.

Version 2.50. Tagged as 'HdrSrc-2_50'
