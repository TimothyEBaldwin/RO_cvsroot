1.1.2.1
log
@  Cross-compile version of HdrSrc
Detail:
  Mostly a question of changing directory separators and removing reliance
  upon path variables and system variable expansion. One day, when all
  components use the shared makefiles (or at least use the necessary -pd and
  -i switches to objasm), we will be able to switch over to using this
  version for all builds. In the meantime, I have created a new branch for
  the HdrSrc component, called XCompile, to store these changes. The downside
  is the fact that we'll now have to maintain unrelated changes on both
  branches until they can be merged.
Admin:
  Tested by cross-assembling the BASIC module.

Version 2.46, 4.247.2.1. Tagged as 'HdrSrc-2_46-4_247_2_1'
