1.1.1.1
log
@
Initial import of a small library to provide module version extraction
facilities.  A library is exported containing code providing a single
API to extract version numbers from ROM modules, modules in the RMA and
modules stored in files.

A test program can be built and a Utility can be built which exports
version numbers via system variables.

Tagged as RMVersion-0_02.
