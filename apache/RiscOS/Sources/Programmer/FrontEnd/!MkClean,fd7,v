@  Fixed a buffer overrun
Detail:
  A fixed-size, 256-byte buffer was used in generation of the main menu. If
  the text in the menu exceeded this amount, stack corruption occurred,
  leading to unpredictable crashes.
  Changed to use shared makefiles (to make it easy to get a GPA debug listing).
Admin:
  Tested with, and required by, the new version of !ObjAsm.

1.2
log
@  Finally got the rules stuff sorted. Hurrah.
Detail:
  A few tricks to this; maintain a usage count for greying/ungreying where
  the initial state for an icon is zero, meaning 'unknown', and going to
  either < or > 0 thereafter once the state is determined. That's done
  at load-time from the Defaults and Choices settings. In addition, the
  module has to know when an icon is part of a selection group - normally
  this means a radio button - and detects that when this is happening, the
  'off' rules for items deselected by the selection of another should *not*
  be run. This makes a great deal of difference to behaviour, which is now
  a lot more straightforward and a lot clearer in the code itself.

  The caveat of this is that exclude on = include off / exclude off =
  include on, which never worked before, now should; you can infact totally
  remove inclusion support internally beyond leaving it as syntactic sugar
  for the Desc file by undefining INCLUDES_AS_INCLUDES when building. By
  default, this isn't done, as there's an omission in this work. Since any
  item judged to be in a selection group will not have its Off rules run
  (or On rules unwound IYSWIM) then *any* off item for a radio won't be
  run. What FrontEnd *should* do is compare the list of icons altered by
  the selecting item's selection rules and only run rules for the
  deselecting items that are not part of the other list. It doesn't do
  this, which creates a slight lack of orthogonality overall. It's minor.
Admin:
  Tested it as heavily as I easily can in UpgCreate. Ensured that Link
  still works. Had a quick look at menu behaviour (sane); brought Docs up
  to date.
