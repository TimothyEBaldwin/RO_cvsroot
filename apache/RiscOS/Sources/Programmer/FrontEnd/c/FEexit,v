1.2
log
@  Refuses to die if in use.
Detail:
  A new flag in the application structure is set if an application is
  running. Finalisation code checks this flag and if set, raises an
  error, stopping the module from dying. This should prevent anyone
  accidentally loading the module when applications which are using it
  are running.
Admin:
  Tested via. various killing methods (*RMKill at CLI and in a task
  window, reloading the module) whilst applications were and were not
  running. Behaviour followed expectations.

  Beware that FrontEnd 1.23 and earlier do not have this protection in;
  before loading 1.24 at run-time, ensure you have quitted any apps that
  are using it (see instantiations for FrontEnd in the *Modules list).

Version 1.24. Tagged as 'FrontEnd-1_24'

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of FrontEnd module to CVS from Aquarius.
Detail:
  Code claims to build FrontEnd 1.16 (11 Jan 1995), but will not
    build in current build environment.
Admin:
  Does not compile - checked in for reference purposes only.
  Tagged appropriately.  Use tag FrontEnd-1_16 to extract version
    which builds in the current build environment.
