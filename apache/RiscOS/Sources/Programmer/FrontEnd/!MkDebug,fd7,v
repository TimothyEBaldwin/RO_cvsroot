log
@  Fixed a buffer overrun
Detail:
  A fixed-size, 256-byte buffer was used in generation of the main menu. If
  the text in the menu exceeded this amount, stack corruption occurred,
  leading to unpredictable crashes.
  Changed to use shared makefiles (to make it easy to get a GPA debug listing).
Admin:
  Tested with, and required by, the new version of !ObjAsm.

Version 1.31. Tagged as 'FrontEnd-1_31'
