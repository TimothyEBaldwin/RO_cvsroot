1.2
log
@  Fixed the "spurious blank line" problem.
  Builds completely cleanly now.
Detail:
  The extra blank line problem has been solved.  This was caused by
    multicharacter lineend character sequences (\r\n or \n\r) being
    delivered split across different TaskWindow messages.
Admin:
  Tested by getting DecAOF to disassemble a large file.  No more spurious
    blank lines appeared.
