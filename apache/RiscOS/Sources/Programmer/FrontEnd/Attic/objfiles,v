1.2
log
@  Great many changes and a few fixes.
Detail:
  See 'ReadMe' in the Docs directory. Summary - new includes and selections
  rules, rules_start/rules_end section, lists before rules keywords, actions
  can take place when icons go off as well as on, and more.
Admin:
  Tested new features a reasonable amount by playing around with the UpgFetch
  front-end. Link still behaves as it should, and all the other Desktop tools
  run without any parser errors or obvious faults in behaviour.


Version 1.23. Tagged as 'FrontEnd-1_23'

1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of FrontEnd module to CVS from Aquarius.
Detail:
  Code claims to build FrontEnd 1.16 (11 Jan 1995), but will not
    build in current build environment.
Admin:
  Does not compile - checked in for reference purposes only.
  Tagged appropriately.  Use tag FrontEnd-1_16 to extract version
    which builds in the current build environment.
