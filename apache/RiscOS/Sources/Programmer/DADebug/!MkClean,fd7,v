1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of DADebug module into CVS.
Detail:
  Made the module 32-bit compatible, and decided it was about time it was in
  CVS, since I've been using it for the last 2 years.
Admin:
  There are accompanying tweaks to DebugLib to use this module, but I've not
  checked those in yet.

Version 0.04. Tagged as 'DADebug-0_04'
