@Fix DADebug to build properly with objasm, add initial support for running from ROM
Detail:
  Makefile - rewritten using makefile fragments, added ROMSupport option
  !MkRam, !MkRom - updated to correctly build RAM/ROM versions of module
  s/DADebug - Added an AREA to keep objasm happy. Added initial, hacky ROM support (compare PC against hardcoded ROM start address & relaunch module from RAM if we think we're in ROM). Added builtin ability to automatically call *DADPrint every 60 seconds, for situations where keyboard input isn't possible
  Doc/DADebug - Updated with notes about running from ROM
Admin:
  Tested on Rev C2 beagleboard

log
@  Initial import of DADebug module into CVS.
Detail:
  Made the module 32-bit compatible, and decided it was about time it was in
  CVS, since I've been using it for the last 2 years.
Admin:
  There are accompanying tweaks to DebugLib to use this module, but I've not
  checked those in yet.
