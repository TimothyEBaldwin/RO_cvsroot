@Make DADebug run from ROM properly
Detail:
  !MkRom,fd7, Makefile, Doc/DADebug, s/DADebug - Removed the ROMSupport hack and replaced with a new system that allows the module to function immediately after initialisation instead of having to wait for the next callback.
  The module now uses workspace to store its variables, and the DADWriteC routine is stored as part of that workspace, allowing DADWriteC to function even though it doesn't get passed a workspace pointer.
Admin:
  Tested in Iyonix ROM build

@Fix DADebug to build properly with objasm, add initial support for running from ROM
Detail:
  Makefile - rewritten using makefile fragments, added ROMSupport option
  !MkRam, !MkRom - updated to correctly build RAM/ROM versions of module
  s/DADebug - Added an AREA to keep objasm happy. Added initial, hacky ROM support (compare PC against hardcoded ROM start address & relaunch module from RAM if we think we're in ROM). Added builtin ability to automatically call *DADPrint every 60 seconds, for situations where keyboard input isn't possible
  Doc/DADebug - Updated with notes about running from ROM
Admin:
  Tested on Rev C2 beagleboard
