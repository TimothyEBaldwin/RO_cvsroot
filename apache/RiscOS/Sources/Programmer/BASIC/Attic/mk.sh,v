@  Tweaks to permit BASIC to cross-compile
Detail:
  * Changed file paths to forms that also work when cross-compiling
  * Changed case of filenames so they match on case-sensitive filing systems
  * Makefile needs to use leading tabs
  * Escaped the '$' in 'BASIC$Crunch' (squashes a warning in new version of
    objasm - unrelated to cross-compilation)
Admin:
  Cross-compiles OK with Norcroft tools, though asasm can't stomach the
  expressions BASIC uses. Checked it still builds with RISC OS Norcroft.

Version 1.59. Not tagged
