@Avoid global OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas
Detail:
  s/Assembler - Have the inline assembler keep track of the original P% value, so the OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas call that's made on exit can be a ranged op instead of a global one
Admin:
  Tested on iMX6
  Resolves some performance issues with SMP ROM, where global OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas actually does a ranged clean of RMA + AppSpace due to lack of global D-cache clean

@VFP/NEON assembler improvements
Detail:
 - Makefile - Add hdr.VFPMacros as a dependency of VFPData
 - Tests/VFP/TestVFP,ffb - Add some assembly tests for the new instructions
 - VFPLib/VFPLib - Remove some non-standard patterns ('D' and 'F' used as data type specifiers). Add the ARMv8 (AArch32) VFP/NEON instructions, and VFPv3 half-precision VCVTB/VCVTT
 - hdr/VFPMacros - Save a few KB of ROM space by changing some tables to use halfword elements instead of words
 - s/VFP - Add VFP_LDRH macro to deal with the compressed tables. Fix VMRS of MVFRn registers (erroneously attempted to convert the digit to upper-case), and add MVFR2

  hdr/Definitions - Update FPSCRCheck macro to allow alternate error handlers to be specified
  s/Array, s/Factor - Update FSQRTD error checks to use VFPException_SQRT, so that they say "negative root" instead of "invalid operation"

@Automatically pick the best FP model for the hosting CPU
Have BASIC V pick either BASICVFP or BASIC VI as appropriate for the current CPU, so if there's VFP hardware don't emulate everything as FPA opcodes.
The BASIC64 command (moved to BASIC V) will now automatically RMEnsure then enter the respective module. If there's something depending on the internal workings of BASIC VI and wishes to explicitly select that even when VFP is present a new command, *BASICFPA, forces BASIC VI to start.
By having BASIC V manage this selection we in effect remove the requirement to remember to RMEnsure the floating point version, which is usually either forgotten about or wrong anyway.
Compatibility wise
  RISC OS 5 includes all 3 variants (2 if no VFP) and will adopt the new logic.
  Existing RISC OS 5 stable releases have always included BASIC V and VI, so will work as before (through emulating FPA).
  Soft loaded modules inside !System will be handled by a disc based update.
Changed files
  CmdHelp: adds the new BASIC64 help/syntax message
  Basic.s: qualify the FPA version in it's startup banner
  ModHead.s: add the new selection logic, and move the 'VFP' help to be a suffix so the module names line up nicely in *Modules again
Tested in both ROM and disc based guises on ARMs with and without VFP hardware.

@Suppress help on TWIN/TWINO
The TWIN & TWINO commands were changed to cause 'Mistake' in BASIC 1.54, but because we retain the tokens in the token table (so that programs which include the tokens can still be read) they still appeared in response to HELP. Notch then out of the HELP.
In removing the HTWIN and HTWINO tokenised HELP lookup this revealed that the end of table marker was wrong and BASIC kept scanning until it fell off the end of memory - the code expects a terminator of 127.
In fixing that it turned out that in BASIC 1.23 the token for 'HELPTOKENNO' was accidentally turned into an error message, and subsequently into token 'E13', when in fact it's only ever looked up as text (not an error).
Put this back as string shorter 'HHELPNO' and use the slot for E13 for the new 'Bad MODE' error from BASIC 1.70; delete HTWIN and HTWINO.

@MODE improvements
Detail:
  1. MODE <string> now uses OS_ScreenMode 15 rather than *WimpMode, to avoid programs which use it (likely unintentionally) altering the Wimp mode or having to worry about preserving it
  2. If OS_ScreenMode 15 isn't supported, use our own mode string parsing code that provides a similar level of functionality to the host system's *WimpMode
  3. For all MODE variants which use OS_ScreenMode, detect any "SWI not known" error and replace it with "Bad MODE" (under the assumption the user is running pre-OS 3.5)
  4. Add a new variant, MODE <x>,<y>,<modeflags>,<ncolour>,<log2bpp>[,<hz>] to allow specification of the three parameters necessary for selecting the new screen modes introduced by RISC OS Select/5

@Debugger symmetry, assembler fixes, and add AArch32 ARMv8 instructions
SRS changed to accept R13 as a synonym for SP.
Fix stack imbalance in CHKCOPRO, CHKREG1 expected R14 & R1 to be stacked but only R1 was, so a copro number not starting CP
  CDP 5,0,C1,C2,C3
for example led to a abort on instruction fetch when returning from CHKREG.
The syntax help for STC and LDC was missing the <cpreg> source/dest register.
Fix for LDREXH & STREXH rejecting odd numbered Rt. The check for -EXD was only looking at 1 of the 2 size bits in the output instruction, so -EX and -EXB allowed odd Rt, but -EXH inherited the checks intended for only -EXD.
ARMv8: Added ISHLD/NSHLD/OSHLD/LD options to DMB & DSB; HLT #imm16; SEVL; CRC32; LDA[B|H]; LDAEX[B|H|D], STL[B|H]; STLEX[B|H|D].
This completes the review of all the opcodes (see also BASIC-1_63).

Tests/ARMv6v7/TestARMv8 has samples of the new opcodes in action.

@Follow the ARM ARM for VFP opcode VDUP despite a tokens clash
Earlier versions of the VFP assembler extensions cooked up VDPL as a way to dodge the problem of opcode VDUP being tokenised as VDUPRINT when used in its scalar or unconditional form (ie. VDUP.<size> <regs>).
This can be handled with an exception in the tokeniser in a similar manner to MOVEQ and ORR in the conventional ARM instruction set.
VFPLib: change the tables to use VDUP rather than VDPL.
Lexical.s: watch out for specifically VDUP. and tokenise it as VDU followed by a P in memory.
Assembler.s: watch out for token VDU followed by a P and take it to be VDUP.
VFP.s: when matching, allow the token for VDU to expand as though VDU was seen, also, add support for backslash and REM comments (previously only semicolon was allowed).
Tests/VFP/TestVFP: update the test case and 3 other failing tests from earlier fixes.
Tests/Match/TokVDUP: brute force trial of all combinations of VDU and PRINT, to check only VDUP. is caught.

@Restore old number formatting logic
Detail:
  The BASIC64 number formatting code was found to be significantly different to the BASIC105 formatting code, and a potential source of compatibility issues due to the various bugs and quirks it seemed to contain
  To resolve this, the BASIC105 number formatting code has been resurrected and adapted to allow it to be used by both BASIC105 and BASIC64
  The formatting code still uses BCD internally, so accuracy will be the same as BASIC 1.65. It's just the formatting discrepancies (for both BASIC versions) which will have been affected.
  MAXDIGS has also been revised again; the +2 is no longer required (was a BASIC64 quirk), so BASIC105 is down to 11 (up from 10 in pre-1.65 versions) and BASIC64 has reverted to the historic value of 18 (which is technically one more than necessary)
  File changes:
  s/fp2 - Updated as described above
  Tests/Math/AtPercent,ffb - New test program which compares the E/F/G number formatting code against a (BASIC105-style) reference model for the number formatting implemented in BASIC

@Increase accuracy of 5-byte float to string conversion
Detail:
  This change rewrites the BASIC105 version of the FCONA routine so that it converts the value to FPA packed decimal format, with ~16 decimal digits of accuracy. To avoid adding an FPA dependency to BASIC105 this is done via a new, custom routine.
  Apart from improving the accuracy of the result, converting to packed decimal allows the rest of the function body to be shared with the BASIC64 variant of the routine.
  File changes:
  s/fp2 - Updated as above. New FACCtoBCD function added to perform the BCD/packed decimal conversion. MAXDIGS for BASIC105 increased to 11+2. Minor FRDFPEXPBIN optimisation.
Admin:
  Tested on BB-xM
  Although the new FCONA implementation is known not to be fully accurate, testing with Test.Math.Decimal shows a marked improvement over the previous implementation, with ~100m random float -> string -> float conversions being performed without any loss of accuracy

@Fixes and improvements
Detail:
  s/Expr - Clean up some confusing code relating to l-value address offsets in LOOKU5. The old code looked like it contained a bug for BASIC64 (two TEQs back-to-back), but the situations LOOKU5 is called in meant it was fine and the TEQs were actually unnecessary.
  s/HelpMsgs - Fix MSGPRNXXX and friends corrupting R1. Was causing LVAR to crash/malfunction when listing functions/procedures.
  s/Stmt2 - Fix rotated ellipses being completely broken in BASIC64. Looks like this has been broken forever (bug appears to be present in BASIC64 1.05, as supplied with RISC OS 3)
  s/fp2 - Increase MAXDIGS by one for BASIC64, to allow for accurate float -> string conversion for numbers of the form 0.0XXXX when using G format.
  s/fp2 - Rewrite BASIC64's string -> float conversion code. Although the old code was believed to be sufficiently accurate, excessive use of FPA instructions made it rather slow, and a poor fit for any future VFP version of BASIC (the code relied on extended precision for accuracy, which VFP lacks). The new version converts to packed decimal and then relies on FPEmulator to perform the decimal -> float conversion via LDFP (to mirror float -> string conversion via STFP). The reduction in FP instructions makes it many times faster than the original ("Decimal" test runs 5x faster)
  Tests/CALL,ffb, Tests/Math/Array,ffb, Tests/Math/Decimal,ffb, Tests/Math/ELLIPSE,ffb - Add a handful of new test programs.

@Two parsing bug fixes
Lexical.s:
Rework previous fixes (revision 1.5 and revision 1.4) for BPUT#TRACE,<number> confusing the MATCH routine.
While revision 1.5 was better it failed to tokenise IF <expr> GOTO 1234 when the THEN is omitted.
A review of all the keywords shows the only ones that take tokenisable line numbers are TRACE, RESTORE, ON, GOTO, GOSUB and of these only TRACE can be used in a function like manner.
So, only apply the fix from revision 1.5 if it's a TRACE token.
Fix from Martin Avison, fixes ticket #387.
Added a test case in Tests/Match/TokTrace to assist.

Assembler.s:
Only consider SP or LR or PC to be referring to a register name if used in isolation (not as a substring of another word).
While LR and PC aren't particularly common start of words in english, SP is, causing source code with such names to give a "Missing ," error.
We adopt the same logic as for invalid 'R' named variables (eg. r17foo, r9bar) and attempt to find a variable with that name instead.
Fixes ticket #386.

@  Changed Basic module so it correctly reports ERL after an external abort.
Detail:
  There was a significant problem with Basic when external code is called using
  CALL, USR, SYS, or a *command (either directly or using OSCLI), and that code
  Aborts with Data Transfer, Undefined Instruction or Instruction Fetch. The
  Error Line (ERL) then given by Basic was often the last line of the program,
  rather than the Basic line containing the CALL, USR, SYS or *command.

  The problem was caused when the Basic LINE pointer in R12 (which points to
  the current line) was corrupted, and that is used by Basic to find the
  program line number (ERL) after an error. If R12 is outside the program, ERL
  was set to zero or the last line of the program, which was useless for
  problem diagnosis.

  After an Abort in a SYS, or in a module *Command (issued direct or via
  OSCLI), R12 is always corrupted. After an Abort in code executed from a CALL
  or USR then R12 is corrupted only if the called code changed it.

  In addition, if r13_usr was corrupted, the Basic error handler was reset
  to the default, causing the program to end abruptly without any line number
  at all.
Admin:
  The changes have been added to CVS in four stages in preceding commits. This
  commit is to increment the module version number, and adds test code supplied
  (as were the module changes) by Martin Avison:

  The test program Aborter creates a module AbortMod which has SWIs and module
  commands which abort in each possible way. The same code is also saved to
  disc to create disc commands for the same function.

  The test application !AbortTest creates many sorts of error and abort, and
  displays the error details.

@Fix min/max limits of NEON immediate shift instructions
Detail:
  VFPLib/VFPLib - Added "g" and "h" immediate constant types. Updated descriptions of existing types. Fixed VQSHL{U}, VSHL, VSHLL and VSLI to use the correct immediate types.
  s/VFP - Added support for the new immediate constant types. Fixed VFPop_imm6 masking the immediate value against (1<<bits)-1, causing the wrong constant to be encoded when imm==size

@VFP/NEON assembler fixes and improvements
Detail:
  * Reworked to make ROM builds reference VFP/NEON assembler lookup tables held in ResourceFS instead of using local copies held in the module. Saves ~32K of ROM space due to reduced data duplication between BASIC & BASIC64.
  * Replace OPT flag magic numbers with symbols
  * Added support for VFPv4/ASIMDv2 instructions (VFMA/VFMS, VFNMA/VFNMS)
  * Updated DCFD/EQUFD to add support for .VFP and .FPA suffixes, to indicate whether VFP or FPA word order should be used
  * Added DCFH/EQUFH for storing half precision floats (in advanced half precision format)
  * Rework MSG routine to preserve R4-R7, for passing to BASICTrans as message parameters
  * Added a few new error messages (118-123) for the VFP/NEON assembler
  * Enable OWNERRORS option for standalone builds, and set DO32BIT to 0 for 26bit builds
  * Fixed VLDM/VSTM style register lists not working correctly when using commas to list the registers
  * Improved handling of VFP/NEON 8 bit immediate constants:
    - No longer possible to use #I64.<n>, #F32.<n>, #F64.<n> notation to directly specify the 8-bit encoded value for I64/F32/F64 constants, nor to force one instruction to attempt to use a constant in a format that doesn't match the .<dt> instruction suffix
    - Instead, .I64 constants can either be specified as a number (which will be converted to an integer and then zero-extended to 64 bits) or a string (which will be parsed by the 64bit version of OS_ReadUnsigned)
    - .F32 and .F64 constants should now be specified as floating point numbers which will then be correctly converted to the 8 bit encoding
    - .F32 and .F64 constants which can't be converted will result in a error message indicating the closest possible floating point number that can be encoded (but not necessarily the closest number that can be encoded; e.g. when assembling NEON instructions the assembler can automatically make use of .I32 encoding formats for some numbers)
  * Fixed instructions that have an 'imn' field (e.g. VSHR immediate) being incorrectly assembled
  * VFPLib.GenData & VFPLib.VFPLib now stored as text instead of tokenised BASIC
  Files changed:
  * Makefile, VFPLib.GenData, VFPLib.VFPLib, hdr.VFPMacros, hdr.Workspace, s.Assembler, s.Basic, s.ErrorMsgs, s.Factor, s.ModHead, s.VFP

@Add TBA Software's VFP/NEON assembler
Detail:
  This is version 0.06 of TBA's VFP/NEON BASIC assembler, with the following modifications:
  * VFPASM makefile option can be used to toggle the assembler on/off. Currently only used by the Tungsten ROM, due to lack of ROM space.
  * EnableVFPDebug switch added to turn on/off debugging code
  * VFP_Error macro fixed (VFPError symbol wasn't defined in 0.06 sources; now it just calls MSGERR directly)
  * Debug messages tweaked to make them a bit more useful
  * Single-register LDM/STM swapped for LDR/STR to avoid objasm 4 performance warnings
  * Fixed a bug in VFPop_imm_bits that caused parsing of immediate constants to fail in ROM builds, and potentially fail or misbehave in RAM builds. A sequence of conditional instructions incorrectly had the 'S' flag set on each instruction, which could cause the execution to stop halfway through.
  * VFPLib BASIC file moved from Tests.VFP folder into all-new VFPLib folder
  * Makefile modified and VFPLib.GenData script added, in order to allow s.VFPData to be built automatically as part of the build process instead of relying on a prebuilt version in CVS
  File changes:
  - Doc/VFPdoc - VFP assembler implementation notes & usage notes
  - Tests/VFP/!Setup,feb, Tests/VFP/TestVFP,ffb, Tests/VFP/VFPLibAsm,ffb, Tests/VFP/VFPLibTest,ffb - VFP test programs
  - VFPLib/GenData,ffb, VFPLib/VFPLib,ffb - Common BASIC files used to generate the pattern tables used by the assembler, and used by the test programs
  - s/VFP, hdr/VFPMacros - Main VFP/NEON assembler source code
  - Makefile - Modified to allow automatic generation of s.VFPData file
  - s/Assembler - Modified to call VFP assembler for instructions starting with 'V'
  - s/ModHead - Replaced ADRL with a sequence of ADD instructions due to module now being over 64K in size

@Bugfix: the TITLE routine was stacking and unstacking R13. This is defined
as UNPREDICTABLE in the ARM ARM, and while it seems to have been harmless on
older ARMs, the XScale corrupts R13 - in this case, it was always loaded with
the value &80F0. This meant that you couldn't load untokenised BASIC programs
via the *BASIC command because TOP was already above the bottom of the stack!
Also optimised a non-aligned data copy routine a little bit.

@  Fixed bug spotted on csa.programmer in BASIC CASE statements.
Detail:
  The expression evaluation in the BASIC WHEN statement had an omission
  where it could skip past a syntax error without generating any error.

  For example, "WHEN (R%>>25) AND 1)=1 : do something" would not return
  an error because the expression is complete and evaluated upto the
  "AND 1". Once this is found to not match the condition of the CASE,
  BASIC searches forwards for the next ",", "WHEN", "OTHERWISE" or
  "ENDCASE", skipping over the ")=1" part.

  I've changed this so that, after the expression is evaluated and found
  to not match, BASIC already checks to see if the next char is a ",". If
  not, we check for a ":" or CR before scanning forwards. Any other char
  is a syntax error.

@  * Performance tweaks.
  * Comments added.
  * Added DIM LOCAL.
Detail:
  * All of the 408 instances of pushes and pops of a single register
    (i.e. "LDMIA SP!,{PC}") have been replaced with an LDR/STR equivalent,
    which provides a small performance boost on StrongARM-like processors.
  * Some obscure bits of the source have had comments added.
  * The new DIM LOCAL statement has been added:

    Syntax: DIM <numeric variable> LOCAL <numeric expression>

    DIM LOCAL allocates space from the BASIC stack rather than from the
    heap. This means that the space allocated is automatically freed on
    exit from the PROC or FN in which it was claimed.

    As with all LOCAL statements, it must appear in a PROC or FN definition
    and cannot appear inside a structure which uses the stack (i.e. NEXT)
    or after a LOCAL ERROR.

    Much like the manner in which "DIM foo% -1" returns the value of FSA
    without allocating space, "DIM foo% LOCAL -1" returns the value of SP
    at the time of the request, without allocating any space from the stack.
    This can be useful in computing the free space between the top of the
    BASIC heap and the bottom of the stack. Of course, the stack is used by
    BASIC while interpreting the program, so the contents of memory below
    foo% should always be treated as undefined.

    One caveat of using DIM LOCAL is that the stack cannot be moved while
    there are DIM LOCALs defined. END= will return an error and any
    Service_Memory calls will be claimed for the duration of the DIM LOCAL.

@  Fix to *BASIC command.
Detail:
  *BASIC will now return an error if it fails for any reason. This is
  slightly more polite than the SVC mode infinate loop it used to go
  into.

log
@  Fixed bug in Exit handler

Detail:
  The new addition which allows an exit code to be passed using the syntax
"QUIT <expression>" was incorrectly assuming it had access to the workspace
via ARGP when it didn't, this caused a data abort when issuing *quit from
BASIC, or in fact when any program called from BASIC called it's exit
handler.

  It turned out that the required parameters for OS_Exit were already being
pointed to by R12, so a simple LDMIA was sufficient.

4.5
log
@  Some bug fixes and a few new features.
Detail:
  * ALIGN will now force any unused bytes to zero when assembling at
    both P% and O%. This is better than leaving possibly uninitialised
    memory behind (makes diffs very difficult).

  * The assembler now correctly recognises the new 'LR' special variable
    when the L is lower-case.

  * The assembler also has the 'SP' (13) special variable defined.

  * TRACE PROC (and the identical TRACE FN) now flushes the VCACHE when
    it is encountered.

  * TRACE ENDPROC has been implemented to allow the output of 'ENDPROC'
    and 'ENDFN' in the trace output whenever a procedure or function is
    exited. This complements the TRACE PROC/FN functionality.

  * QUIT <expression> has been added to allow a return code to be passed
    back to the called when BASIC exits. This is the /only/ sensible way
    for a BASIC program to set Sys$ReturnCode on exit (others get trashed
    when BASIC removes it's environment handlers).
Admin:
  Tested on a StrongARM RiscPC.

  Some of the reformatting from the last checkin has been improved.

  s.ModuleAB and s.ModuleAB64 have been renamed to s.BASIC105 and
  s.BASIC64 respectively. This will help with the new Brodie Make-o-
  Matik(tm) Makefiles.
