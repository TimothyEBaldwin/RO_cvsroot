@Add TBA Software's VFP/NEON assembler
Detail:
  This is version 0.06 of TBA's VFP/NEON BASIC assembler, with the following modifications:
  * VFPASM makefile option can be used to toggle the assembler on/off. Currently only used by the Tungsten ROM, due to lack of ROM space.
  * EnableVFPDebug switch added to turn on/off debugging code
  * VFP_Error macro fixed (VFPError symbol wasn't defined in 0.06 sources; now it just calls MSGERR directly)
  * Debug messages tweaked to make them a bit more useful
  * Single-register LDM/STM swapped for LDR/STR to avoid objasm 4 performance warnings
  * Fixed a bug in VFPop_imm_bits that caused parsing of immediate constants to fail in ROM builds, and potentially fail or misbehave in RAM builds. A sequence of conditional instructions incorrectly had the 'S' flag set on each instruction, which could cause the execution to stop halfway through.
  * VFPLib BASIC file moved from Tests.VFP folder into all-new VFPLib folder
  * Makefile modified and VFPLib.GenData script added, in order to allow s.VFPData to be built automatically as part of the build process instead of relying on a prebuilt version in CVS
  File changes:
  - Doc/VFPdoc - VFP assembler implementation notes & usage notes
  - Tests/VFP/!Setup,feb, Tests/VFP/TestVFP,ffb, Tests/VFP/VFPLibAsm,ffb, Tests/VFP/VFPLibTest,ffb - VFP test programs
  - VFPLib/GenData,ffb, VFPLib/VFPLib,ffb - Common BASIC files used to generate the pattern tables used by the assembler, and used by the test programs
  - s/VFP, hdr/VFPMacros - Main VFP/NEON assembler source code
  - Makefile - Modified to allow automatic generation of s.VFPData file
  - s/Assembler - Modified to call VFP assembler for instructions starting with 'V'
  - s/ModHead - Replaced ADRL with a sequence of ADD instructions due to module now being over 64K in size
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM in ROM & softload forms
