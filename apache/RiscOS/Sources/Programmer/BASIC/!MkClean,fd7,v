@Add "BASICVFP", a VFP version of BASIC64
Detail:
  See Doc/BASICVFP for overall design/specification
  File changes:
  - !Mk,fd7, !MkClean,fd7, !MkRom,fd7, Makefile - update build scripts to support BASICVFP target
  - Resources/UK/Messages - Add a few new messages
  - hdr/Definitions - Define BASICVFP register usage and a few utility macros
  - hdr/WorkSpace - Define BASICVFP workspace adjustments. Add a few asserts to check some workspace constraints are maintained.
  - s/* - Lots of changes to add support for BASICVFP variant of the module
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 1/2/3, BB-xM

  Sources changed to be objasm-compatible.

4.2
log
@  Some bug fixes and a few new features.
Detail:
  * ALIGN will now force any unused bytes to zero when assembling at
    both P% and O%. This is better than leaving possibly uninitialised
    memory behind (makes diffs very difficult).

  * The assembler now correctly recognises the new 'LR' special variable
    when the L is lower-case.

  * The assembler also has the 'SP' (13) special variable defined.

  * TRACE PROC (and the identical TRACE FN) now flushes the VCACHE when
    it is encountered.

  * TRACE ENDPROC has been implemented to allow the output of 'ENDPROC'
    and 'ENDFN' in the trace output whenever a procedure or function is
    exited. This complements the TRACE PROC/FN functionality.

  * QUIT <expression> has been added to allow a return code to be passed
    back to the called when BASIC exits. This is the /only/ sensible way
    for a BASIC program to set Sys$ReturnCode on exit (others get trashed
    when BASIC removes it's environment handlers).
Admin:
  Tested on a StrongARM RiscPC.

  Some of the reformatting from the last checkin has been improved.

  s.ModuleAB and s.ModuleAB64 have been renamed to s.BASIC105 and
  s.BASIC64 respectively. This will help with the new Brodie Make-o-
  Matik(tm) Makefiles.
