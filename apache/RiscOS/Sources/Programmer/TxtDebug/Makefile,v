@A debugging module, making the screen-plotting code previously included only
in MPEGDriver modules available via the DADebug API (and therefore all the
debugging libraries that support DADebug). Module name not currently
registered. Should ideally have its own SWI chunk too, but that would mean
having to update the debugging libraries.
