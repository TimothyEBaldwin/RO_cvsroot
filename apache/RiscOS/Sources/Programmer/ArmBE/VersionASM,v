@Remainder of data constants swapped to DCD
The last of the literal pool values which had been disassembled turned back into DCD,
Most importantly the workspace allocation was expressed as the offset of a function from the start of the module.
Tested briefly, still worked.

@Regenerate the big call table
THe keypress decoder was represented as a load of DCD's which meant moving/inserting/deleting any code anywhere in the sources would make the table out of sync and ArmBE fail in mysterious ways.
Already, 2 table entries were wrong.
Rehomed a couple of data words that got disassembled as EORCS opcodes.

@Fix a couple of disassembler flow analysis mistakes
In two places literal pool values had been assumed to be offsets from the start of the module, when in fact they were the size of data tables.
In turn, this meant label "data_4" split what should have been a relative BL into DCB's, so post the 32 bitting process the BL was to somewhere nonsensical.
Made use of SETV/CLRV macros in a few places.
Added a warning next to a big table that is actually a code offset table - here be dragons.

@  Removed a couple of harmless build errors
Detail:
  Because this is such a simple component at present, it doesn't have a
  header file to export, so you got an error during the export_hdrs phase.
  Also fixed a similar harmless error that would have occurred if anyone
  were to include this module in a ROM build (affecting the resources phase
  in this case, because the module also doesn't have a Messages file).
Admin:
  Tested in a disc build

@Various source clean ups
* Don't use Choices$Dir, use Choices: or Choices$Write (fixes ticket #311).
* Remove post increment of #0, this can be unpredictable on ARMv5 (though none of the actual instances were).
* Comment a few functions.
* Unjumble the various message tokens. The other two big blocks are the border to the popup dialogues and the 2 screens of help.
* Swap common OS SWI arguments for named ones from headers.
* Replace PSR fiddling with macro.
Tested briefly, messages all appear right, and choices are retained over a restart.

@  Import of the ARM BASIC Editor module
Detail:
  An ancient editor for BASIC - what BASIC's EDIT statement launches.
  The original sources cannot be retrieved, so with the permission of Castle
  and Jeff Doggett, who 32-bitted it without sight of the sources, here are
  some sources which have been generated using SID and then some manual
  postprocessing. Note that prior to any further development, these sources
  need a lot of TLC to reassign meaningful symbol names for labels and
  workspace and structure offets.
Admin:
  Checked that binary differences from the version on Jeff's website are
  restricted to harmless differences in the ADRL pseudo-instructions and
  immediate constant encoding in recent versions of objasm, plus SID's
  preference to replace LDM/STM with Pull/Push macros that assemble to
  LDR/STR where only a single register is transferred. Also did a quick
  test run on Iyonix and Raspberry Pi.
