@  Removed a couple of harmless build errors
Detail:
  Because this is such a simple component at present, it doesn't have a
  header file to export, so you got an error during the export_hdrs phase.
  Also fixed a similar harmless error that would have occurred if anyone
  were to include this module in a ROM build (affecting the resources phase
  in this case, because the module also doesn't have a Messages file).
Admin:
  Tested in a disc build

@Allow TARGET != source file name
Makefile now explicitly defines the object required, so TARGET can be passed in different.
297 LDM/STM changed to Pull/Push to eliminate the assembly warnings.

@  Import of the ARM BASIC Editor module
Detail:
  An ancient editor for BASIC - what BASIC's EDIT statement launches.
  The original sources cannot be retrieved, so with the permission of Castle
  and Jeff Doggett, who 32-bitted it without sight of the sources, here are
  some sources which have been generated using SID and then some manual
  postprocessing. Note that prior to any further development, these sources
  need a lot of TLC to reassign meaningful symbol names for labels and
  workspace and structure offets.
Admin:
  Checked that binary differences from the version on Jeff's website are
  restricted to harmless differences in the ADRL pseudo-instructions and
  immediate constant encoding in recent versions of objasm, plus SID's
  preference to replace LDM/STM with Pull/Push macros that assemble to
  LDR/STR where only a single register is transferred. Also did a quick
  test run on Iyonix and Raspberry Pi.
