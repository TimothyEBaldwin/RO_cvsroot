@Various source clean ups
* Don't use Choices$Dir, use Choices: or Choices$Write (fixes ticket #311).
* Remove post increment of #0, this can be unpredictable on ARMv5 (though none of the actual instances were).
* Comment a few functions.
* Unjumble the various message tokens. The other two big blocks are the border to the popup dialogues and the 2 screens of help.
* Swap common OS SWI arguments for named ones from headers.
* Replace PSR fiddling with macro.
Tested briefly, messages all appear right, and choices are retained over a restart.

@                           ARM BASIC Editor
                           ----------------


The ArmBE module is the very ancient (1987) vintage editor for BBC BASIC.

I have converted the module to be 32 bit neutral and have removed its use
of CMOS memory. The 8 bytes are now saved in the choices directory.

The 8 bytes of CMOS were &95-&98 (now DNSIPaddrCMOS)
                     and &B5-&B8 (now PoduleFrugalCMOS for podules 4 to 8)

I have not added any additional functionality so the editor will not be
aware of any changes to BBC BASIC in the intervening 17 years.

I assumed that Castle have long since re-used the CMOS memory locations
that ArmBe used for something else.

log
@  Import of the ARM BASIC Editor module
Detail:
  An ancient editor for BASIC - what BASIC's EDIT statement launches.
  The original sources cannot be retrieved, so with the permission of Castle
  and Jeff Doggett, who 32-bitted it without sight of the sources, here are
  some sources which have been generated using SID and then some manual
  postprocessing. Note that prior to any further development, these sources
  need a lot of TLC to reassign meaningful symbol names for labels and
  workspace and structure offets.
Admin:
  Checked that binary differences from the version on Jeff's website are
  restricted to harmless differences in the ADRL pseudo-instructions and
  immediate constant encoding in recent versions of objasm, plus SID's
  preference to replace LDM/STM with Pull/Push macros that assemble to
  LDR/STR where only a single register is transferred. Also did a quick
  test run on Iyonix and Raspberry Pi.
