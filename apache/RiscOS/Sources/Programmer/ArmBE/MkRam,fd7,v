@Various source clean ups
* Don't use Choices$Dir, use Choices: or Choices$Write (fixes ticket #311).
* Remove post increment of #0, this can be unpredictable on ARMv5 (though none of the actual instances were).
* Comment a few functions.
* Unjumble the various message tokens. The other two big blocks are the border to the popup dialogues and the 2 screens of help.
* Swap common OS SWI arguments for named ones from headers.
* Replace PSR fiddling with macro.
Tested briefly, messages all appear right, and choices are retained over a restart.

@  Import of the ARM BASIC Editor module
Detail:
  An ancient editor for BASIC - what BASIC's EDIT statement launches.
  The original sources cannot be retrieved, so with the permission of Castle
  and Jeff Doggett, who 32-bitted it without sight of the sources, here are
  some sources which have been generated using SID and then some manual
  postprocessing. Note that prior to any further development, these sources
  need a lot of TLC to reassign meaningful symbol names for labels and
  workspace and structure offets.
Admin:
  Checked that binary differences from the version on Jeff's website are
  restricted to harmless differences in the ADRL pseudo-instructions and
  immediate constant encoding in recent versions of objasm, plus SID's
  preference to replace LDM/STM with Pull/Push macros that assemble to
  LDR/STR where only a single register is transferred. Also did a quick
  test run on Iyonix and Raspberry Pi.
