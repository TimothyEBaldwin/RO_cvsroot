@Resolve two differing canonicals
Disc based canonical (supplied with the DDE) takes 1 arg, the variable to expand. The version in this module also requires a path name, doing the assignment too.
Take the disc version to be canonical (!) since that one's in the wild, and remove the 2nd arg from DebugTools.
Docs and test case updated accordingly.
Also:
* Use Unix paths (thing.s not s.thing).
* Makefile recreated from fragments.

  s/Cmnds, s/IRQpatch, s/Module, s/SWIs - Disable *IRQInfo and *UnknownIRQs, they're rather broken for HAL kernels/32bit memory map.
  s/IRQpatch, s/Module, s/SWIs - Remove hardcoded IRQ device count and deduce from OS_ReadSysInfo 6 instead
  s/Module - Read address of VecPtrTab from OS_ReadSysInfo 6. Fix bounds calculations for application space & RMA (OS_ReadDynamicArea returns base in R0, not R1)
  s/Strings - Add UnthreadV to list of vector names
Admin:
  Tested on Rasperry Pi (with zero page relocation)
  *Vectors now works again, and *IRQDevices lists full device count.

1.14
log
@  Improved IRQ despatch vector searching code.
Details:
  The previous revision of this module needed to know the address of both the
  Kernel IRQ despatch code and the despatch vector table. To find this, it
  would attempt to use the OS_ReadSysInfo 6 call. If this failed (i.e. it is an
  older Kernel without the appropriate call), it would have to search for a
  known bit pattern "LDMIA R1,{R12,PC}" in the Cursor/System/Sound area.

  It was known that this routine could, on rare occasions, return a false
  positive from arbitrary data in that area (i.e. in the sound buffers).

  This routine has been improved to use the value of address &100, which is
  documented as being the address of the IRQ despatch code. Thus, we only
  search upwards from this for about 1KB (rather than the full 32KB of the
  area). This will radically reduce the chances of the false positives
  (although they /may/ still happen).
Admin:
  Tested using a RISC OS 3.70 failure case. Now works.

1.13
log
@  Fixed potentially fatal module finalisation bug.
Detail:
  DebugTools freed its workspace on module finalisation, but did
  not store zero in the private word. This means that the Kernel
  would also try to free that address in the RMA, which may have
  been claimed by someone else in the intervening moments. This
  fault was actually seen 100% repeatably with a module on an STB
  (which has the same fault - and one similar in the initialise
  code).
Admin:
  Will work.
  How many other assembler modules will fall down the same hole?

  which are fairly self-explanatory. Two new commands are also there
  in spirit but not yet implemented. These are...


  *Peek and *Poke

  which will allow inspection of logical/physical memory and modification.
  The main difference with *Memory commands is that they tend to read a
  location multiple times, which is no good for addresses in I/O space.

@  * Fix to some pre-RISC OS 4 problems
  * Changed capitalisation of PushD, PopD and Pwd commands
  * Renamed *Devices and SWI Devices to IRQDevices
  * Updated spec
Detail:
  * There were a couple of sillies in some new (untested) code for when the
    module initialises on pre-RISC OS 4 machines. These would have caused a
    DataAbort in module initialisation.
  * Just to be a little more RISC OS, the help and syntax strings have been
    made more conventional for PushD, PopD and Pwd commands.
  * Devices is already used as a *command. This appears to have been missed
    in my allocation request. I've renamed it to *IRQDevices. To keep things
    orthoganal, the corresponding SWI has also been renamed.

@  Bloat. Module is now 10.5 KB. New commands add about 600 bytes...
Detail:
  Added three new *commands: pushd, popd and pwd. The latter of these
  replaces the transient utility of the same name (but it uses OS_FSControl
  to determine how big a buffer it requires for the string - rather than
  a fixed, 256 byte, buffer).

  pushd and popd do the same thing as the UNIX varients (but without any
  of the switches). These two are very useful. Wish all !Mk files would use
  them ;)

@  * IRQ timing stuff is now off by default;
  * Some of the new OS_ReadSysInfo 6 codes used (if available);
  * Some small tidying-up done.
Detail:
  The IRQ timing mechanism involves patching the Kernel's IRQ despatch
  code. This is now off by default. The first call to *IRQInfo will
  activate it. *IRQInfo can also be used to switch the mechanism off
  again.

  Some new subreason codes have recently been added to OS_ReadSysInfo
  6. DebugTools will use these values if they are available.

  The specification in the 'Docs' directory has been updated.
Admin:
  Tested on RO4 RiscPC (OS_ReadSysInfo success stuff untested).

@  *Tickers and the tickers SWI now safer to use!
Detail:
  Previously, the code enumerated the Kernel TickNodeChain by walking-
  along it. This is not too safe if the chain changes while you're
  still walking along it!

  The new version copies the chain into a temp buffer with IRQs off
  before enumerating it. Note: the SWI call now corrupts R0 on exit.

@  * Added a little bit of bomb-proofing to DebugTools' SWI XOS_Write bits;

  * Significant improvements made to the DebugTest module.
Detail:
  * Sequences of OS_WriteX, OS_NewLine and OS_ConvertXXX have been made a
    little more secure using the VC condition code (where appropriate). I
    haven't done this with OS_WriteS of course!

  * The DebugTest module is now quite handy for watching both OS_Module
    and OS_Heap calls - it provides four *commands:

      *OSModule    *OSModule_Read    *OSHeap    *OSHeap_Read

    These commands allow you to watch the number of calls to these SWIs
    for all of the reason codes, and the distribution of block sizes for
    claims. Handy if you're working on OS_Heap (or any heap algorithm).

    It's not yet very useful for tracking memory leaks.

@  Added AHodgkinson's *RMDie and *RMRemove commands.
Detail:
  Rolled the transients into this module as *commands with some
  slight tweaks:

  *RMDie and *RMRemove will not attempt to blat a ROM module.

  *RMRemove will replace the module title and help strings with
  a special name (i.e. not an empty string) so that you can
  still kill the module later.

  Tested quickly on RiscPC.

log
@  Initial version of the DebugTools module.
Detail:
  The DebugTools module provides various useful *commands and SWIs, some
  of which have existed before as stand-alone transient utilities.

  There is a rough specification in the "Docs" directory.

  The main feature of this module from a programmer's perspective is the
  facility to vector the Kernel's OS SWIs, i.e. hang your code off a
  particular SWI to get in before (or instead of) the Kernel.
Admin:
  Includes sources for two test modules in the "Tests" directory.
