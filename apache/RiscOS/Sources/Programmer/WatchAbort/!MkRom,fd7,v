1.1.1.1
log
@  Initial import of WatchAbort module, a debugging aid.
Detail:
  The C runtime system claims the abort handlers, so if an abort happens
  while the current application is written in C (which is a lot of the time
  for embedded systems), the kernel's register dump doesn't get filled in,
  making debugging harder. This module sits on the hardware vectors and notes
  the contents of all registers in all modes (except the mode the vector is
  called in, of course). Currently data aborts and prefetch aborts are
  handled, though undefined instructions and branches through 0 could be
  added fairly easily. Note, however, that you get "false positives" when
  lazy schemes (for aborts) or emulated instructions (for undefined traps)
  are in use - ideally, the whole abort system would be overhauled so that
  this module is no longer necessary.

  Module name and star commands have not been registered.
