1.2
log
@Fix some nasty bugs. Add extensive debug logging code.
Detail:
  s/scheduler - Fix PreEmptionRecovery and ThreadResumed to update LastKnownIRQsema with the new value of IRQsema
  s/scheduler - Fix SVC stack copying code to decrement both pointers instead of incrementing one and decrementing the other. Fix PreEmpt loading the wrong values for SVCStackCopy and SVCStackBase.
  s/scheduler - Fix Yielded loading Context into R2, and thus overwriting any timeout the routine specified
  c/module, hdr/RTSupport, Resources/UK/Messages - Module now errors when RTSupport SWIs are called with nonzero flags
  Makefile, c/module, h/scheduler, s/scheduler - Added lots of debugging code, based around debuglib for C code and DADebug for assembler code. Debug code toggled on/off by passing DEBUG=TRUE to makefile. PC-relative variables shifted to middle of file to keep them within LDR range when debugging enabled.
Admin:
  Tested in OMAP3 ROM on BB-xM
  Fixes issues seen when multiple RTSupport threads are in use

log
@Initial import of the RTSupport module, the real-time routine scheduler.
This has so far been demonstrated to work with a single client under
RISC OS-STB 5.0.0 and 5.0.2.
