log
@  Repeat command made more robust in handling errors in the pre-desktop
  execution mode.
Detail:
  If -stb is supplied to the repeat command (and -tasks is not), it will
  put the first error it encounters into the system variable X$Error (if
  not already set) and then continue execution as normal.
Admin:
  I also updated the CmdHelp file to reflect not only this change, but
  also the -sort switch which was added quite some time ago and to make
  the X command help a little more helpful.
