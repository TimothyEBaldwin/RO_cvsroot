@Add support for progress indication and 'must continue' switch
* The switch '-stb' has existed for some time but is a bit obtuse, renamed to '-continue' (though -stb is still accepted as an alias).
* Added support for BootFX module, via switch '-progress start,range' which will scale the work done and work yet to do into a percentage and pass it to the BootFX module (intended to track boot progress).
* Trimmed out old switched out repeat command code that ran in SVC mode.
* Eliminate last trace of Support011 library, was only using the control terminated version of strlen() which is in ConfigLib (now linked against).
* Const qualifiers added to command handlers.

Version 1.44. Tagged as 'BootCmds-1_44'
