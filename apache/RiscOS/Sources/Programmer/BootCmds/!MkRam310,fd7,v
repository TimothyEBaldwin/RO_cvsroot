4.1
log
@Makefile adapted to accept CMDHELP=None
* Recreated from fragments
* No longer creates two resource areas (one for Repeat, one for messages) since RESGEN can put many files into one area
* No longer does a ResourceFS register in the ROM case - the resources phase now exports both Repeat and messages directly into the messages module
* Corrected error number for BufOFlo (was using the token number!)
* Used newly allocated error base for all other errors
* Internationalised "Can't claim memory" in Repeat
* Fixed a couple of compiler warnings

Version 1.43. Tagged as 'BootCmds-1_43'
