4.2
log
@Turned off 10k leading zero switch in PDumperLJ,this broke more than
it fixed but will almost certainly mean HP810C's wont work now.
Added PDumperCX2 dumper,infact this is derived from PDumperCX since
they're closely related - new Canon printers use 16 bit margin setup
code whereas old ones used 8 bit margin setup.
