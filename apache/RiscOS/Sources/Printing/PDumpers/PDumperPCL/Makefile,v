1.1
log
@  Added PDumperPCL.
Detail:
  Contributed by Herbert zur Nedden and based upon PDumperLJ, this is a
  dumper designed for PCL printers that support duplex printing, such as the
  Canon i-Sensys MF4690PL. See PDumperPCL/!Info for full details.
Admin:
  Tested by the author on the aforementioned printer; ROOL have merely
  checked that it compiles. See PrintDefs 0.46 for the associated printer
  definition file.
