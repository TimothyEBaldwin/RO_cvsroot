log
@  Added PDumperPCL.
Detail:
  Contributed by Herbert zur Nedden and based upon PDumperLJ, this is a
  dumper designed for PCL printers that support duplex printing, such as the
  Canon i-Sensys MF4690PL. See PDumperPCL/!Info for full details.
Admin:
  Tested by the author on the aforementioned printer; ROOL have merely
  checked that it compiles. See PrintDefs 0.46 for the associated printer
  definition file.

Version 1.43. Tagged as 'PDumpers-1_43'

; Changes I made:
; 1. In StartJob set a flag that Job has been started
; 2. In StartPage
;    If flag that job has started then
;    - reset flag that job has started
;    - initialise printer
;    - set duplex based on PDF entry in data10:
;      N = none, S = short binding, L = long binding, R = rotating pages
;      (rotating pages since some printers like Canon iSensys MF4690PL does
;       not do long binding duplex otherwise...)
;    If rotating pages then
;    - send Esc & l 0 O on odd  pages (i.e. do not rotate)
;    - send Esc & l 2 O on even pages (i.e. rotate)
; 3. In EndPage do not send printer reset ('Esc E Esc %-12345X')
