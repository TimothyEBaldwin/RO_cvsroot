log
@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.

Version 0.41. Tagged as 'PrintDefs-0_41'

Read_Me file for Acorn printers.
--------------------------------

The Acorn.JP-150 printer definition file is for
use with the Acorn JP 150 printer, which is a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet Plus compatible printer.
See the HP.Read_Me file for more details.

Note that you should use "Generic DeskJet" paper
sizes in !Printers with the Acorn JP-150 printer.
If you use a version of !Printers earlier than
0.54, it will default to "A4 (Generic LJ)", which
you must change to "A4 (Generic DeskJet)". If you
do not do this, the output may be split over two
sheets of paper.
