@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.

@These printer definition files are for use with the Apple LaserWriter 12/640
and 16/600 printers. The 12/640 supports duplex printing and different feeds.
The 16/600 does not support duplex printing, but does support different
feeds.

The feed options on the LaserWriter 12/640 are as follows:

Single sided, upper cassette
        The 250-sheet cassette

Single sided, lower cassette
        The optional 500-sheet cassette
        
Single sided, multipurpose tray
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when in general use
        
Single sided, envelope/postcard
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when used for envelopes/postcards
        
Double sided, upper cassette
        The 250-sheet cassette with the tops aligned (best for portrait
        binding)
        
Double sided, lower cassette
        The 500-sheet cassette with the tops aligned

Upper first sheet then lower
        The first page is from the 250-sheet cassette. All subsequent sheets
        are drawn from the 500-sheet cassette. This allows you to have the
        first page only on headed paper
        
Upper double sided, tumbled
        The 250-sheet cassette with the tops at opposite ends (best for
        landscape binding)
                
Lower double sided, tumbled
        The 500-sheet cassette with the tops at opposite ends (best for
        landscape binding)
