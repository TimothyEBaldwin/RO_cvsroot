log
@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.

Read_Me file for Olivetti printers.
-----------------------------------

JP 360
------
The Olivetti JP360 is compatible with the Hewlett-
Packard DJ500C printer, so you can use the printer
definition file 'HP.DJ500C'.

Because the JP360 can be fitted with either colour
or black cartridges, you should set the !Printers
configuration (see User Guide) appropriately:

 - When a black cartridge is fitted, use only the
   Mono or Grey options.
 - When a colour cartridge is fitted, use only the
   256, 32 thousand or 16 million colour options.

If the wrong printer configuration is used, the
printer will flash its Online and Form Feed lights
when you attempt to print.
