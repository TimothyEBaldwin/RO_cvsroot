Read_Me file for Canon BJC-250
------------------------------
This PDF is for use with the Canon BJC-250. It is only an interim 
release. The palettes have not been accurately defined, so you may 
find that colour matching is not very accurate. In this release, 
there is no support for the photorealistic or fluorescent cartridges. 

The Canon BJC-250 is factory set to default to BJ emulation. You
need to set LQ emulation before using the 250 with !Printers. This
need only be done once. Refer to the printer user guide, or follow
these instructions:

  - make sure the printer is turned off for at least 15 seconds

  - press and hold the power button, and listen for printer beeps

  - wait for eight beeps, then release the power button

This sets European LQ mode, which is remembered until the set-up
is changed again. The printer is now ready to use with !Printers.

log
@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.
