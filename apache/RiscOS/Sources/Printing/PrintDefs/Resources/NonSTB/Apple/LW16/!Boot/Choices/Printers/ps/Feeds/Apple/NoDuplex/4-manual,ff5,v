log
@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.
