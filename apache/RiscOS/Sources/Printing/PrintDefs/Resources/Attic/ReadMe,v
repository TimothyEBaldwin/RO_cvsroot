@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.

log

  * Makefile alteration to correctly export palette files.

Detail:

  * A new palette file was added in V0.20 (palette 11).  This wasn't
    being exported due to it being accidentally omitted from the makefile
    export rules.  The palette directory is now copied wholesale (using
    a wildcard) rather than copying the individual palette files.
    (The "ReadMe" file has been moved up one directory level to ensure
    that it doesn't appear in the exported resources.)

Admin:

  * Problem discovered in the most recent Lazarus build; the Lexmark Z11
    failed to print when colour was selected due to the missing palette
    file.
