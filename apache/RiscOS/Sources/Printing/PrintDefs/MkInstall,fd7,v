log
@All of the PDFs for desktop machines went missing somewhere in time,this
restores them all and also adds a USBMap,which is used to autodetect USB
printers and map it to a PDF leaf name.
The PDFs will now be stored in !Boot.Resources along with other useful
system features like scrap,and a dummy app !PrintDefs supports this.
Bugger those directories took ages to add.

@  Fixes and changes for STBs.
Detail:
  * Fixed the clean phase of the Makefile to remove Resources.Printers (as
    the Makefile creates this anyway).
  * Updated the Makefile list of RESFILES to squash from the ResSrc
    directory into the Resources directory to include all of those in the
    actual build (also, got the case correct for some of them).
  * Modified the Install phase to install all of the bits required to
    completely replace any build which is already in the ROM. This change
    includes squeezing all of the PDFs, which was not previously the case
    for the disc build - I don't think it will hurt.
  * Reinstated the Lexmark Z12 into the STB400 Supported file.
  * Changed the STB400 !Boot file to include all of the latest fixes and
    work-arounds for various PPrimer, PDriver (et al) bugs - changes which
    were erroneously made to the STBPrint component in cvs.
Admin:
  Builds correctly (comapred against Baseline version).

4.1
log
@  Added an install phase to the Makefile.
Detail:
  The install phase now builds the !STBPrint applet as found in a
  Baseline (!STBBoot/Resources/!STBPrint). This is *not* the same
  as the !STBPrint component used in old STBs to control printing!

  I also removed a litle
  little redundant bit of the Makefile and updated the Supported
  file for STB400.

  The printer definitions in ResSrc/Printers for L6Z11 (BW and Col)
  have been updated to match those on the latest STB Baseline.
Admin:
  This appears to work. The !Boot file installed for STB400 builds
  contains a temporary (as always) bodge to fix a current printer
  fault.
