4.2
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
Usual drill
* Rename CMHG file to be the auto generated one
* Cast away some warnings
* Swap a few header files around, use defs from central headers where available
Also, add hdr/RemotePrin which in turn will be exported and end up in <swis.h>.

Eliminated the RemPrnSptMsgs module target - if we're disc based then carry round and register our own messages (through the magic of the shared makefiles), and if we're ROM based the messages are exported to ResourceFS as usual in the resources phase.

Compiled and ran, messages were correctly registered.

4.1
log
@Addition of RemotePrinterSupport_EnumerateUSBPrinters SWI.
Also now looks for USB devices appearing and disappearing and adds them
to the event list passed to printer manager.
When a new USB printer is plugged in an attempt will be made to find it
in the messages file pointed to by "PrintDefs$Dir.USBMap" to work out
which PDF is needed.When no match is made this is passed to !Printers
anyway incase it wants to ask the user to choose one themselves.
Also #if'd out the whole of the debug file when not doing debug versions
which makes it smaller and removes some,ahem,text strings!
