@Changed to use objasm to avoid any LDR rN,[rN],#0 problems
Changed to use shared Makefiles
Numerous small 32 bit conversion improvements
Bugfix to PDriverPS,it was pulling LR not PC - this has been the case for
many years so not sure how it ever worked.
Due to a bug in objasm 3.27 this checkin will infact not build directly.
You must first
 - rename the PDriverDP dir to PDriverDP2
 - rename the PDriverPS dir to PDriverPS2
 - move the 2 source files of the same name up a directory
checked in in this way to minimise messing in CVS.

;; 19-Mar-92 DDV 3.27 Bug fix: Left / Top margins adjusted to include the print border
;; 31-Mar-92 DDV 3.28 Bug fix: service reset corrupting registers
;; 30-Oct-92 SAH 3.29 PDriver_SelectJob (+Illustration) corrupted R7.  (Core.SWIs).
;; 02-Aug-93 PAH 4.00 Incorporated SAH Changes to add support for LIBRA1
;; 14-Sep-93 PAH 4.01 fixed black border bug - maybe!
;; 05-Oct-93 SAH 4.02 Bugfix: use stringwidth (not bounding box) when calculating justification
;;                      offsets.  This is because the bounding box returned by Font_ScanString
;;                      does not include the distance moved by 'move' control sequences at the
;;                      start and end of the string.
;; 15-Oct-93 PAH 4.03 Bugfix: Medusa Printing is much slower - Behaviour of wimp_claimFreeMemory
;;                      has changed, it no longer returns the max ammount of mem. available,
;;                      temporary work around fix.
;; 02-Nov-93 PAH 4.04 Bugfix: Printing in mono/landscape can result in noise at the top of the
;;                      page
;;                    Bugfix: Pressing escape on Medusa could lead to strange error messages,
;;                      this was because the error buffer (part of the job's ws) was freed before
;;                      the message is displayed (In accordance with PRM). Unfortunately
;;                      the new error module then overwrites this bit of memory.
;; 16-Nov-93 PAH 4.05 Bugfix: Pdriver_setInfo would cause error if colour is set
;;                    Work-around:  abort_job clears output stream - stop's pages being printed
;;                      when background printing escaped.
;; 30-Nov-93 SAH 4.06 Bugfix: the option to pass the initial font handle in via R0
;;                      did not work because it got corrupted before it was used.
;; 30-Nov-93 PAH 4.07 Bugfix: Printing large/wide sprites would cause incorrect rectangle values
;;                      to be passed to SpriteExtend. Also affected printing from different modes!
;;                    Bugfix: Printer to error diffused could crash 'cos all the memory had been
;;                      allocated
;;  8-Dec-93 PAH 4.08 Bugfix: fixed 2nd stage of jumble error messages when pressing escape
;; 14-Jan-94 PAH 4.09 Bugfix: not capable of printing more than one page, incorrectly calling
;;                      PdumperAbortJob
;; 19-Jan-94 PAH 4.10 Bugfix: plot sprites that have a divisor of 1 in the scale factor, were
;;                      causing the spirte_put code to freeze due to division by zero
;; 19-Jan-94 JSR 4.11 Up version number only - change was in MakeFile install dependancy
;; 20-Jan-94 PAH 4.12 Bugfix: Printer name was lost if PdriverInfo was called in middle of
;;                      job
;; 01-Feb-94 PAH 4.13 Bugfix: Colourtrans_selecttable only behaves differently with R5 bit 4
;;                      set when source is either 16 or 32bpp
;; 03-Feb-94 PAH 4.14 Bugfix: Take into account that wimp_claimfreememory now returns all the
;;                      memory available to it
;; 16-Feb-94 PAH 4.15 Bugfix: Aborting a job by pressing escape would leave the printer in a
;;                      confused state.
;;                    Bugfix: Going from TrueColour to old sprites requires numourous 32K tables
;;                      to be generated - ensure there is enough space in RMA before
;;                      Wimp_ClaimFreeMemory tries to grab it all.
;; 18-Feb-94 SAH 4.16 Stopped Core routines masking out bit 4 of R5 on entry to sprite
;;                      plotting SWIs.  This bit gets passed through to SpriteExtend where
;;                      it means "use the sprite's palette in preference to the translation
;;                      table".
;; 24-Feb-94 PAH 4.17 Bugfix: MED-03014. Printing 2up landscape from impression would crash
;;                      - cause was handle16/32bpp_rotation looping once too much.
;; 03-Mar-94 PAH 4.18 Bugfix: Thought minimum amount of memory required for internal strip
;;                      buffers was 4 times for 16million and 2 times for 32 thousand
;; 09-May-94 AMG 4.19 Bugfix: (Core) Don't use bignum as default terminator to string in
;;                      intercepted font_paint - caused immediate termination if string to
;;                      be printed was in rma on a Risc PC (rma is at &02100000 but bignum
;;                      is only &02000000)
;; 12-Sep-94 AMcC 4.21 Version is now set in shared Version file (version number now in
;;                       line with SrcFile).
;; 13-Sep-94 MJS  4.22 Changes for JPEG plot support
;; 30-Sep-94 MJS  4.23 More JPEG changes - rectangle pre-scan to calculate JPEG memory
;; 21-Oct-94 MJS  4.24 Support for wide translation tables on Sprite plot
;; 25-Oct-94 MJS  4.25 Footling change - use proper global symbols for JPEG SWI's
;; 17-Nov-94 MJS  4.27 Bug fix - make sure 'not enough memory' error is not ignored in the
;;                     case where rectangle pre-scan allowed (OOPS! caused a machine crash).
;;                     Also, make sure any error diffusion buffer is freed on such error.
;; 23-Nov-94 MJS  4.28 Refuse to initialise if PDriver not active - ie. be dormant in ROM,
;;                     provided PDriver is later in chain. Change JPEG allocation to cater
;;                     for SPriteExtend now using dynamic area (not RMA). Try to allow up
;;                     to 1/16 of total memory free (eg. for complicated Draw path). Shrink
;;                     SpriteArea after allocation to fit whole number of strips (free wastage).
;; 25-Nov-94 MJS  4.29 Give proper error message if PDriver not active
;; 01-Dec-94 MJS  4.30 Fix bug with 16-bit colour depth, landscape, odd no. of rows in strip
;;                     (eg. possible with Epson Stylus Colour PDF)
;; 06-Jan-95 MJS  4.31 Fix bug with PDriver_AbortJob corrupting R4 (MED-04280)
;; 03-Mar-95 MJS  4.33 Fix MED-04626 (deep sprites -> grey not gamma corrected)
;; 10-Jul-95 MJS  4.37 Make sure strip sprite is a multiple of 8 pixels wide (may be assumed
;;                     by newer, faster code in PdumperSpt, pdumpers). Respond to (seteval'd)
;;                     numeric system var PDriverDPMaxMem, if present, to set max memory in
;;                     Mbytes to be used for strip sprite.
;; 29 Apr 97 JRC  4.40 Added 'Colour' debug flag, made SpriteV interception routine a NOP if
;;                     a Wimp error box is open (Service_WimpReportError), added InUse message for
;;                     use by PDumpers.
;; 07 May 97 JRC  4.41 Enable escapes round all calls to PDumper, and also replace the escape handler
;;                     with a NOP (otherwise, we end up calling the current escape handler when we
;;                     acknowledge the escape, which has potentially horrible consequences).

@Added UpCall to provide information about what the dumper is doing.
Detail:
UpCall made at exit from dumper routines to enable page counting. Could also be used for things like progress indication. Code is in place for UpCall at entry to dumper, but not assembled at present.
Admin:
Tested with module provisionally called PMonitor.

4.1.7.3
log
@   Enable escapes round all calls to PDumper.
   Replace the caller's escape handler with a NOP. Otherwise, we end
up calling the current escape handler when we acknowledge the escape,
which has potentially horrible consequences. In the case of the C
library, the escape handler is expecting to have to raise a signal,
and if it can't do this is generates an error instead.

;; 07 Aug 97 AR		Moved the final redirection to the screen to after the call to abort code
;;			Abort code can ( on escapes ) send reset info to the printer.
;; 13 Aug 97 AR		Added code to handle the command SWI.  This essentially passes control to 
;;			the dumper that is connected. The handler is kept in the private file
