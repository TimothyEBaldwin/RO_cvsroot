@Fix to FNsupported_baudrates to avoid "Bad DIM" when no serialdevdriver
is present.
Fix usb_device_removed to start looking at the list from 0.
Make shared USB printers remember their shared settings.
Change in SuppSrc to avoid oflaofla in the queue display with two digit
connection types (eg.CN13 for USB).
Template changes to connection window.
Added "duplicate" entry to control menu.
Added "install new printer" to iconbar menu (opens PrintDefs:)
Rename control menu to have title "Control"
Added laserjet 5 and 6 paper definitions to the built in sizes so it
doesn't default to size A2.
Fix to store_string so it only asks for the right amount of store.
Change to Makefile to rmensure some modules so SWI names get squished.
Removed a whole load of unused variables.
Plugging in an unknown USB printer prompts the user to tell us which
it really is.
Now appends "#alternateN" to the devicefs filename for USB.
Fix to loading of old style PDF files (borken ungstrans in suppsrc).

@Addition of USB "plug-and-play" support.This version is a little ropey and
is here for reference rather than use.
Fix to SupportPS to silently ignore the absence of a "Feeds" directory
and simply have a default menu entry instead (OSGBPB -> XOSGBPB).

4.3
log
@Dustbinned all the !Sprites23 files.
Addition of long dump string support (requires appropriate modules too).
Serial baud rates now detected at run time with OS_SerialOp rather than
plucking them out of a messages file.
Debug build made to work (use !MkDebug) outputs much debugging to a RAM
disc.
Adobe PDF support removed (the sources remain) as this is RISC OS Ltd code.
Test PDF files added to the Test directory.
