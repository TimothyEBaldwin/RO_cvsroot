@Addition of USB "plug-and-play" support.This version is a little ropey and
is here for reference rather than use.
Fix to SupportPS to silently ignore the absence of a "Feeds" directory
and simply have a default menu entry instead (OSGBPB -> XOSGBPB).

4.1
log
@Dustbinned all the !Sprites23 files.
Addition of long dump string support (requires appropriate modules too).
Serial baud rates now detected at run time with OS_SerialOp rather than
plucking them out of a messages file.
Debug build made to work (use !MkDebug) outputs much debugging to a RAM
disc.
Adobe PDF support removed (the sources remain) as this is RISC OS Ltd code.
Test PDF files added to the Test directory.
