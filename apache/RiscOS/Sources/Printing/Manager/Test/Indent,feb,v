4.1
log
@Dustbinned all the !Sprites23 files.
Addition of long dump string support (requires appropriate modules too).
Serial baud rates now detected at run time with OS_SerialOp rather than
plucking them out of a messages file.
Debug build made to work (use !MkDebug) outputs much debugging to a RAM
disc.
Adobe PDF support removed (the sources remain) as this is RISC OS Ltd code.
Test PDF files added to the Test directory.

Version 1.65. Tagged as 'Manager-1_65'
