@Write through the right system variable
Remove the misuse of PrinterChoices$Path for writing through
* It's stated in the sources it only ever has one directory on it, so might as well not be a path
* It's not in !Printers allocated namespace
* We can save some effort canonicalising it
Drop support for the define 'UseChoices'; always use them.
Global search and replace of PrinterChoices: for <Printers$ChoicesRW>. (cf. Boot$ChoicesRW).

@This is an initial import of a tool I have been using to test PDF files
on a RiscPC without having to soft load on an STB or such like.

It is development code and was written tongue in cheek.  But as all useful
tools do, has proved useful to the point that it would be a shame to lose
the source.

It is anticipated to grow as we seem to have misplaced the source to the
tool used to convert RiscPC pdf files to the NC style, this can be added
to this tool.
