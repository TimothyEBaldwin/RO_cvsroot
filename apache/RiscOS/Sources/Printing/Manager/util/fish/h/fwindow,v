@This is an initial import of a tool I have been using to test PDF files
on a RiscPC without having to soft load on an STB or such like.

It is development code and was written tongue in cheek.  But as all useful
tools do, has proved useful to the point that it would be a shame to lose
the source.

It is anticipated to grow as we seem to have misplaced the source to the
tool used to convert RiscPC pdf files to the NC style, this can be added
to this tool.
