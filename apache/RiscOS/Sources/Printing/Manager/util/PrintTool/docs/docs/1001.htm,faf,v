<h2>What this Application does.</h2>
Because some inks are heavier than others and some paper is more absorbant we need a from of balancing. These adjustments take the form of a correction to the values of ink placement and is done through a palette.  This application allows you to edit such a palette suiting your paper and ink types.
<BR><BR>
Because of the numbering of palettes for different types of printers, no attempt is made by the application to create new palettes.  As such it requires you to manage your use of palettes.  As a general rule one PDF ( Printer Definition File ) will use only one palette.  However this is not always the case and for some printers with dramatically different methods of printing this will change for these differing methods.  In theory each of the options that can be selected, through the printer control dialogue, may select a different palette.  These are the different selections for types of paper or print quality.  More often however these selections will use the same palette within a PDF.
<BR><BR>
Palettes are not used in text printing only graphics.
