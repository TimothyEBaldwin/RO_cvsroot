1.2
log
@  small changes to ensure building with new version of ABClib, subject
  to its addition to the source tree.
  removed the duplicate files in the docs directory and moved the real
  docs to the docs directory.
Detail:
   my mistake for building a product that used libraries that don't
   exist in the source tree.
Admin:
  this has not been tested other than building and opening starting to run
  generally this is a simple application wrapping around strong algorithms
  already used for the command line version of this application.

Version 0.00. Not tagged

Above is the dialogue window that is selected using !Printers to configure a printer.  Under "Printer options" there is a selection for "Resolution" this indictes the type of print quality that is used.  When you wish to change the palette for a particular method of printing take a note of this setting.  Then load the PrintEdit application and drop the PDF on the icon.

This should provide the following window.  The area of interest is the "Graphics modes".  By clicking on the menu to the right of this section you are provided with a list of graphics modes.  These should be identical to that list given in the !Printers control window.  Select the print quality that you are interested in.  This will give a further window.

The only thing of interest is the "palette file" on the left of the top section.  If you have created another palette change only that entry to the new file name.  It is this file name that you will need to enter into the !PrintTool application.
