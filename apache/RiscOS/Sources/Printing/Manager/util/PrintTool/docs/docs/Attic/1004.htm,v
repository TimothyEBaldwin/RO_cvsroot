1.2
log
@  small changes to ensure building with new version of ABClib, subject
  to its addition to the source tree.
  removed the duplicate files in the docs directory and moved the real
  docs to the docs directory.
Detail:
   my mistake for building a product that used libraries that don't
   exist in the source tree.
Admin:
  this has not been tested other than building and opening starting to run
  generally this is a simple application wrapping around strong algorithms
  already used for the command line version of this application.

Version 0.00. Not tagged

This window allows greater control over the palette.  The values that define the greater control here are derived from other values in the simplified window.  This help page describes the differences between the two windows.<BR><BR>This window also more closely replicates a command line application that preceeded this, as such the order of which items appear is in a different order than the simplified window.
<h3>Saturation</h3>
<ul>
<li><EM>Error Diffuse Density;</EM>&nbsp;This is the position of maximum ink.  It is used to space the colour map to within a range from 0 to this value.</li><BR>
<li><EM>Brightness</EM>&nbsp;This has two values these are for error diffusion and half-tone methods of colour approximation.  Half-tone has been removed for the simplified window as it is not used in the majority of cases.</li><BR>
<li><EM>Contrast</EM>&nbsp;This exactly the same.</li>
</ul>
<BR><BR>
<h3>Colour Biases and Maximum Levels</h3>
<ul>
<lh>This is again the same as the simplified window.</lh>
</ul>
<BR><BR>
<h3>Grey Level Replacement</h3>
<ul>
<lh>The difference here is the second value.  This value is used as the maximum level, in most cases this is 100%.  For this reason this value is left out from the simplified dialogue.<BR><BR>
Min. Non-Zero Black is the same as "Start replacing at:"
