log
@  small changes to ensure building with new version of ABClib, subject
  to its addition to the source tree.
  removed the duplicate files in the docs directory and moved the real
  docs to the docs directory.
Detail:
   my mistake for building a product that used libraries that don't
   exist in the source tree.
Admin:
  this has not been tested other than building and opening starting to run
  generally this is a simple application wrapping around strong algorithms
  already used for the command line version of this application.
