@Initial version of HALTester - simple kernel for HAL testing
Detail:
  Simple, easy-to-modify kernel to allow testing of HAL functionality before trying a new HAL with a real RISC OS kernel.
Admin:
  Used during development of OMAP3 HAL. Tested under qemu-omap3.


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'HALTester-0_01'

; Forcibly ensure that options only intended for one class of platform
; stay there. Generally this involves combining switches with the STB
; switch. The exception is processor architectural stuff. 7500FE is
; included always, and StrongARM has an independed switch.
;
; When you want to migrate features from one platform to another you'll
; find that every occurence of feature switches has been qualified with
; the appropriate sense of the STB switch. This is to remind you to think
; about what you're about to do! Check whether the code actually will work
; at all on something that is or is not a STB class product.
;
; Using the STB switch this aggressively also help ensure that there's
; no unexpected code crossover in the initial merge.
