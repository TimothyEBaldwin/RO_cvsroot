log
@  Initial import of S3C6410 HAL
Detail:
  The S3C6410 HAL is aimed at the Mini6410 board. There's a major bug
  somewhere which prevents the FP emulator from working (crashes on
  initialisation), and the interrupt handling is broken (which is believed to
  break USB). But video works (hardwired to 480x272), though the cursor hasn't
  been implemented yet, and the debugging console works.
