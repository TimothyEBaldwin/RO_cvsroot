@Add compressed ROM support. Make softload-aware.
Detail:
  hdr/Post, s/FlashProg - Add sizeofROM definition, for expected size of compressed ROM/physical ROM chip. Used to replace references to OSROM_ImageSize throughout the code.
  s/ATA, s/Boot, s/Debug, s/DebugPCI, s/IIC, s/Interrupts, s/MSI, s/NVMemory, s/Timers, s/Top, s/UART - Removed unnecessary GETs of Hdr:ImageSize.<ImageSize>
  s/Boot, s/Video - Add a new 'Tungsten video' HAL device, for storing the NVidia STRAP data that the softload & ROM flash tools need to poke into the ROMs on a per-machine basis. Previously the data was stored in the NVidia module, which would have caused complications with compressed ROM images.
  s/RAM, s/Top - Add compressed ROM & softload support. Softload code just skips some hardware initialisation and relocates the ROM to the high end of RAM.
Admin:
  Tested as Tungsten ROM softload only.
  For safety, compressed ROMs that have been burnt to ROM are required to be 4MB in size. This helps to simplify the ROM consistency checks and recovery code.
  Softloaded ROMs aren't subjected to the FlashCheck code and can be any size.

@Kevin's new PCI enumeration C.
Kevin's UART control for DualSerial to talk to.
Completion of flash recovery stuff - it now flashes the floppy drive
light appropriately then requests a new OS image down the serial port
but is careful never to erase itself.To allow this has required some
shuffling to ensure the first 8k of binary is fixed and makes no
external calls - "s.Top" arranges this and effectively moves the
HAL up 8k in ROM.
