@Turn off debug
Anyone using the serial port for other peripheral uses might get confused if some HAL debug comes out on it.
Move the IMPORTs into a header so we don't end up with lots of unresolved symbols with Debug {FALSE}.
Rename a couple of symbols in PAudio missed in OMAP3-1_03.
Built, but not tested.

@Tidy up board-specific code. Improve Pandora support.
Detail:
  hdr/board, s/board, s/Boot - Tidied up board-specific code a bit by adding more board-specific function pointers to the BoardConfig struct instead of relying on manual board detection in code.
  s/board - Disable Pandora VideoGPIO as turning the LCD on & off seems to result in graphical corruption, most likely due to settings which were set by the SPI interface being lost.
  s/KbdMatrix, Makefile - New file for handling the Pandora's keyboard matrix (and anything else that may require keyboard matrix code in the HAL). Contains stub code for the boot-time keyboard scan, and code to register a keyboard HAL device for detection by the PandoraKey module.
  s/Boot - Add soft-off support for Pandora. Add Pandora-specific initialisation code to enable some extra power supplies (touchscreen, nubs, audio DAC, EHCI PHY)
  s/KbdScan - Use Pandora-specific keyboard scan code instead of USB code when running on Pandora
  s/SDIO - Correct sense of MMC activity LEDs on Pandora. Now only lit during periods of activity, to match behaviour of the Pandora Linux distro.
  s/Video - Add some switched out hack code to allow easier debugging of aborts that occur during ROM initialisation
Admin:
  Tested on Pandora, rev C2 BB, rev A2 BB-xM, rev C1 TouchBook

@Fix unreliable warm reset on some BB-xM boards. SmartReflex tweaks.
Detail:
  s/TPS - Added code to correctly configure the TPS/TWL to deal with warm resets. Required to make sure VDD1/VDD2 are set back to default when a reset occurs, thereby fixing the hang on reset that some people have been experiencing
  s/Boot - Add code to call TPS_Init
  s/SR37x - Improve debug code. Change initial OPP1G voltage from 1.35V to 1.38V, as recommended by datasheet
  s/KbdScan - Add a bit more debug output
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 BB, A2 BB-xM, C1 TouchBook
  Fixes issue reported on forums with resets not working following addition of SmartReflex driver:

@Add compressed ROM support. Add boot timing code. Other misc tweaks.
Detail:
  hdr/omap3530, s/Boot, s/KbdScan, s/Top, s/Video - Added code for profiling/timing the startup sequence, using the 32K system timer
  s/Boot - Ensure VAUX2 is enabled during EVM startup
  s/Boot, s/CPUClk - Go to full CPU speed during HAL_Init instead of HAL_InitDevices.
  s/KbdScan - Print out heap usage stats when debugging is enabled
  s/NVMemory - Skip probing for CMOS carrier board if JTAG is active
  s/RAM, s/Top - Use DMA to relocate the ROM image instead of simple memcpy code. Relocate compressed ROMs to a location suitable for decompression.

  Tested with compressed & uncompressed OMAP3/OMAP3Live images

@Prep for SDFS and support for hardware CMOS adapter board.
To avoid conflicting use of the SDIO controller by higher level filing system (and the need for a HAL to somehow ask for a disc to be reinserted) this HAL onwards supports hardware CMOS attached via the JTAG connector.
On power up the presence and size of EEPROM is detected (sizes from 256 to 2048 bytes are understood corresponding to 24AA02 to 24AA16 family of parts).
If no EEPROM is found the HAL falls back to permitting a CMOS file to be loaded off the SD card, but crucially this is done by uboot before FileCore starts.
If no EEPROM is found, or the CMOS file looks suspicious, some fake CMOS is made and the kernel defaults used.
The "ProbeEESize" switch enables size probing, otherwise 256 bytes is assumed.
The "TryLoadedCMOS" switch enables use of a CMOS file from the SD card, if that's off and nothing is found the HAL declares that there is no CMOS at all!
The respective boot script needs the line
  fatload mmc 0:1 0x4020F000 cmos
adding to it, though the filename 'cmos' is arbitrary and only used as a suggestion.

@Update OMAP3 HAL to support keyboard scan on boot, plus other changes
Detail:
  Makefile, s/KdbScan, hdr/StaticWS - Code to handle keyboard scanning, via the new HAL build of the USB drivers.
  s/Stubs - Removed old stub keyboard scan routines
  s/CPUClk - ADR -> ADRL to cope with new workspace layout
  s/Boot, s/Top, hdr/Post - Modified to use new HALSize variable for determining the HAL size. Trimmed dead code/definitions.
  s/Boot - FIQDebug code now copes with the different USER button GPIO used on the BB-xM
  s/board - Increased max pixel rate from 86.5MHz to 100MHz. This allows a wider range of screen modes to be used, although it is beyond the spec of the video controller, and not all boards will be able to reach 100MHz. This should match the value used in the initial ARMini units.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 BB, A2 BB-xM, C1 TouchBook
  Needs latest USB drivers, Kernel source, BuildSys & Env (not all of which have been checked in yet)
