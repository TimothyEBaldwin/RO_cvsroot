log
@  Initial import of S3C2440 HAL
Detail:
  The S3C2440 HAL is aimed at the QQ2440 board (a Mini2440 clone), but as it
  doesn't address any hardware not on the S3C2440 chip, it should be adaptable
  to any board using it. Video mostly works (no cursor, plus it's hardwired to
  a 480x272 screen), as does USB. It would probably be useful should anyone
  want to develop an A9Home port.
Admin:
  Code submitted by Tom Walker.
