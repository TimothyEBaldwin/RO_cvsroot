@Allow mixer devices to indicate the range of supported gain values
Detail:
  This adds support for version 0.1 of the HAL mixer device API. Mixer devices which implement this version of the API are able to indicate the min/max gain values each mixer supports, along with the smallest gain step.
  Docs/SoundCtrl - Updated to describe how this new information is exposed to RISC OS
  h/MixerDevice, hdr/MixerDevice - Updated mixer device structure definitions
  c/module - Added code to read gain information if present. Also fixed runtime mixer registration/deregistration to accept any device of version 0.x instead of 0.0
Admin:
  Tested in OMAP3 ROM & Tungsten ROM softload.


Version 1.01. Tagged as 'SoundCtrl-1_01'

log
@Import of initial version of SoundControl (HAL variant).

This module pinches the name, SWI base and error block of its Phoebe
equivalent (now moved to RiscOS/Sources/Audio/SoundCtrlPhoebe), but is a
completely new implementation.
