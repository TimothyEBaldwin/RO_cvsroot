1.2
log
@Change to use CModule shared makefile.
Debug redirection set to PRINTF_OUTPUT since HOSTFS_OUTPUT doesn't exist (allows debug version to compile again).
Participated in a ROM build, but not functionally tested.

Version 1.02. Tagged as 'SoundCtrl-1_02'

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of initial version of SoundControl (HAL variant).

This module pinches the name, SWI base and error block of its Phoebe
equivalent (now moved to RiscOS/Sources/Audio/SoundCtrlPhoebe), but is a
completely new implementation.
