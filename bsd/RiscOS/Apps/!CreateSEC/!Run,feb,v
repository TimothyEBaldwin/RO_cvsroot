log
@Imported some tools which are useful for builds.

* UnTarBZ2
* CreateSEC
* Routines

Various bits of software which are useful for building stuff should really
live in the RISC OS source tree somewhere. !Routines is a special case; it's
required by !CreateSEC and the source code to all its various bits lives at
7th software, but putting a binary import in RiscOS/Apps isn't that unusual.
