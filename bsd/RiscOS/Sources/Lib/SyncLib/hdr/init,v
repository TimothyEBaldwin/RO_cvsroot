@  Extra function to assist with ARMv8 compatibility
Detail:
  atomic_update_byte() is the equivalent of atomic_update() but deals with
  byte-wide rather than word-wide data fields. It operates using either
  SWPB or LDREXB/STREXB instructions, depending upon the architecture, and
  is therefore suitable for updating any modules which currently use SWPB
  explicitly in order to make them compatible with ARMv8 where the SWPB
  instruction has been removed.
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 3.

Version 0.02. Tagged as 'SyncLib-0_02'

@  Initial import of SyncLib
Detail:
  SyncLib is a library containing architecture-independent synchronisation
  primitives. It supports uniprocessor and SMP systems, even though RISC OS
  itself does not (yet) support SMP - but it allows individual modules to
  start to be modified in preparation for any such future support. The
  library adjusts itself according to the architecture targeted by your
  chosen build, so in particular when used in ROM builds, only supported for
  the appropriate CPU(s) will be included.
Admin:
  SyncLib is used heavily by SDIODriver and SDFS - they have acted as a test
  bed for the library and also as a proof of concept for SMP-ready modules.
