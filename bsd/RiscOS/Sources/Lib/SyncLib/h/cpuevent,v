@  Initial import of SyncLib
Detail:
  SyncLib is a library containing architecture-independent synchronisation
  primitives. It supports uniprocessor and SMP systems, even though RISC OS
  itself does not (yet) support SMP - but it allows individual modules to
  start to be modified in preparation for any such future support. The
  library adjusts itself according to the architecture targeted by your
  chosen build, so in particular when used in ROM builds, only supported for
  the appropriate CPU(s) will be included.
Admin:
  SyncLib is used heavily by SDIODriver and SDFS - they have acted as a test
  bed for the library and also as a proof of concept for SMP-ready modules.
