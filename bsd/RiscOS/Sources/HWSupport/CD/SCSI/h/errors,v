1.1
log
@Add initial version of CDFSSoftSCSI
Detail:
  New CDFS driver module that aims to support all SCSI CD/DVD drives that conform to the MMC SCSI specification. This includes USB attached ones, assuming SCSISoftUSB is loaded.
  Known issues:
  - Only supports MODE SENSE/SELECT 10, so drives which only work with MODE SENSE/SELECT 6 won't work
  - CD speed get/set currently unsupported
  - Inactivity timer multiplier get/set not supported on some drive types
Admin:
  Tested with softload on Iyonix, ROM build on OMAP3
  Only confirmed to work with one drive model so far - expect a few tweaks to be needed to cope with non-conformant drives


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'SCSI-0_01'
