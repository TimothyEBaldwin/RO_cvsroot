@Add Thomas Milius' PandoraKey module
Detail:
  Kindly donated by Thomas Milius, this module provides a keyboard & mouse driver for the builtin keyboard of the Pandora handheld.
  This is version 0.32 of the module, with minor tweaks to allow it to be built by the ROOL build system.
  At the moment the driver only supports the use of the Pandora's keyboard; gamepad and nub support is forthcoming.
Admin:
  Builds but untested


Version 0.33. Tagged as 'PandoraKey-0_33'
