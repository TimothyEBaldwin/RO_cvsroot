1.1
log
@Add support for nubs + GPIO keys. Tidy up a few bits.
Detail:
  c/gpio, h/gpio - General GPIO handling code
  c/gpiokey, h/gpiokey - Code for handling the GPIO-attached keys (gamepad buttons), to emulate some extra keyboard keys
  c/nubs, h/nubs - Code for handling the analogue nubs, to emulate mouse input
  c/pandorakey, h/pandorakey - Moved data arrays to C file to avoid multiply defined symbols when header is #included elsewhere. Changed to use exported definitions for key & vector numbers instead of local definitons. Removed from the keyboard matrix handling the bits which are now handled by the nubs & GPIO keys. Use OS_IICOp for IIC transfers to ensure register reads don't get interrupted by other transfers.
  Makefile - Added new files
Admin:
  Tested on Pandora


Version 0.35. Tagged as 'PandoraKey-0_35'
