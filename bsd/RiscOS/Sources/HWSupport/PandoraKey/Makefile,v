log
@Add support for nubs + GPIO keys. Tidy up a few bits.
Detail:
  c/gpio, h/gpio - General GPIO handling code
  c/gpiokey, h/gpiokey - Code for handling the GPIO-attached keys (gamepad buttons), to emulate some extra keyboard keys
  c/nubs, h/nubs - Code for handling the analogue nubs, to emulate mouse input
  c/pandorakey, h/pandorakey - Moved data arrays to C file to avoid multiply defined symbols when header is #included elsewhere. Changed to use exported definitions for key & vector numbers instead of local definitons. Removed from the keyboard matrix handling the bits which are now handled by the nubs & GPIO keys. Use OS_IICOp for IIC transfers to ensure register reads don't get interrupted by other transfers.
  Makefile - Added new files

  Tested on Pandora

@Add Thomas Milius' PandoraKey module
Detail:
  Kindly donated by Thomas Milius, this module provides a keyboard & mouse driver for the builtin keyboard of the Pandora handheld.
  This is version 0.32 of the module, with minor tweaks to allow it to be built by the ROOL build system.
  At the moment the driver only supports the use of the Pandora's keyboard; gamepad and nub support is forthcoming.
Admin:
  Builds but untested
