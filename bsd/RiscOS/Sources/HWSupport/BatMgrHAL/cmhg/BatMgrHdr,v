@Build fix
With BuildSys-6_60 and later ROM apps need to explicitly request RISC_OSLib during the rom_link phase.
Removed asm.s, we can get RO$$Base from AsmUtils instead.
Renamed CMHG file to fit the autogenerated name from the shared makefiles.
Built, but not tested.

Version 0.28. Tagged as 'BatMgrHAL-0_28'
