@Build fix
Don't set RES_OBJ to an empty string.
Make use of INSTRES_FILES to simplify the resources phase.

@Build fix
With BuildSys-6_60 and later ROM apps need to explicitly request RISC_OSLib during the rom_link phase.
Removed asm.s, we can get RO$$Base from AsmUtils instead.
Renamed CMHG file to fit the autogenerated name from the shared makefiles.
Built, but not tested.

log
@Initial version of new, HAL-friendly BatMgr app/module
Detail:
  Written in plain C, this version of BatMgr is designed to be used with the new BMU interface used by PortableHAL.
  In theory it could be extended to cope with the old style interface (and have the A4/Stork battery monitoring logic added), but for now the new interface is all it supports.
  The application frontend is very minimal, currently just an icon on the iconbar showing the state of the battery/batteries.
  Iconbar menu, about box, and other features to be added at a later date.
  For development on machines which don't implement the BMU interface, a debug version which uses fake values can be built by enabling the TESTBED #define in bmu.c
Admin:
  Tested in ROM on BB-xM, Pandora, TouchBook
