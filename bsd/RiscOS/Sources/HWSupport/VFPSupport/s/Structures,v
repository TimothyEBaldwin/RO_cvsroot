@Add initial version of VFPSupport module
Detail:
  Initial VFP/NEON support code for RISC OS. Features:
  * Basic detection code for determining VFP version. Should work OK on all architecture versions.
  * Provides code to perform VFP/NEON context switches
  * Context switches can be lazy or immediate
  * Context register dumps can be stored in user-allocated memory or memory allocated by VFPSupport
  * Basic APIs for examining contexts and reporting available hardware features
  * "FastAPI" that privileged code can use for context switching in order to avoid SWI call overheads
  Missing/unfinished features:
  * No VFP exception handler is present, so the module will refuse to run on anything but a VFPv3 system
  * Lazy context switching is simplistic, opting to activate the new context upon the first undefined instruction abort instead of checking to see if it was a VFP instruction that triggered the abort
  * No interface to allow debuggers to easily get their hands on a register dump following a crash
  * No code to automatically clean up contexts left behind by dying programs
  * Can't be used by FIQ handlers, or from code called by an FIQ handler
  * Currently uses an error base of 0!
  Other notes:
  * Doc/vfpversions contains some random notes about the different VFP/NEON versions
  * Test/test1,ffb is a BASIC program that tests most of the module's functionality
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix & Beagleboard. Iyonix version exits correctly, while Beagleboard version passes all tests in the test1 script.
  Need to sort out proper error numbers, and translate the error messages.
