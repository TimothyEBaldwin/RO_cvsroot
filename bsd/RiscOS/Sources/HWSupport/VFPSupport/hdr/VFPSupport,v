@Use official error block. Disallow instantiation. Warn clients before finalising.
Detail:
  Resources/UK/Messages, s/Errors, hdr/VFPSupport - Errors now declared in public header. New/updated error messages and symbols.
  s/GetAll - Changed GET order to work with errors in header file
  s/Module - Disallow instantiation. Manually issue Service_ModulePostFinal during finalisation, to give clients slightly more warning than the kernel does.

@Rename those constants like I said I would
Detail:
  s/Module, hdr/VFPSupport - VFPSupport_Create_LazyActivate & VFPSupport_Create_Activate now renamed to ..._CreateContext_... like they were meant to have been in my last checkin

  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM

log
@Tweak VFPSupport API and add support for contexts stored in application space
Detail:
  s/Module, hdr/VFPSupport - New/changed features:
  - Contexts can now be flagged as being in application space if they're created with the VFPSupport_Context_AppSpace flag
  - VFPSupport_ChangeContext accepts a VFPSupport_ChangeContext_AppSpace flag, which will force the context change to occur in a nonlazy manner if the currently active context is in application space
  - VFPSupport_CreateContext accepts a VFPSupport_CreateContext_LazyActivate flag, to indicate that after creation the context should be activated lazily (unlike VFSupport_CreateContext_Activate)
  - VFPSupport_Context_Activate renamed to VFPSupport_CreateContext_Activate for clarity
  - VFPSupport_CheckContext now ignores the Activate/LazyActivate flags, so the same flag word can be passed to Check & Create
  - "Context ID" simplified to just "Context pointer", as an indiciation of the fact that I now have no plans to make VFPSupport keep a master list of extant contexts
    - This makes it legal for programs to move/copy/delete contexts as long as they've made sure that the ExamineContext doesn't indicate that any part of the context is active
  - VFPSupport_ExamineContext now returns the context size in R4 instead of the context ID
  Test/test1,ffb - Updated to work with new API
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM.
  VFPSupport_ExamineContext change is backwards-incompatible!

@Add initial version of VFPSupport module
Detail:
  Initial VFP/NEON support code for RISC OS. Features:
  * Basic detection code for determining VFP version. Should work OK on all architecture versions.
  * Provides code to perform VFP/NEON context switches
  * Context switches can be lazy or immediate
  * Context register dumps can be stored in user-allocated memory or memory allocated by VFPSupport
  * Basic APIs for examining contexts and reporting available hardware features
  * "FastAPI" that privileged code can use for context switching in order to avoid SWI call overheads
  Missing/unfinished features:
  * No VFP exception handler is present, so the module will refuse to run on anything but a VFPv3 system
  * Lazy context switching is simplistic, opting to activate the new context upon the first undefined instruction abort instead of checking to see if it was a VFP instruction that triggered the abort
  * No interface to allow debuggers to easily get their hands on a register dump following a crash
  * No code to automatically clean up contexts left behind by dying programs
  * Can't be used by FIQ handlers, or from code called by an FIQ handler
  * Currently uses an error base of 0!
  Other notes:
  * Doc/vfpversions contains some random notes about the different VFP/NEON versions
  * Test/test1,ffb is a BASIC program that tests most of the module's functionality
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix & Beagleboard. Iyonix version exits correctly, while Beagleboard version passes all tests in the test1 script.
  Need to sort out proper error numbers, and translate the error messages.
