@Fix save/restore of contexts which have pending exceptions
Detail:
  s/Module - Fixed context save & restore code to ensure FPEXC EX & FP2V bits are clear when accessing FPSCR and the main VFP registers. Without doing this, attempting to save or restore a context which has a pending exception will trigger an exception itself.
  Test/test2,ffb - Simple test to make sure save/restore of contexts with pending exceptions works properly
  Test/test1,ffb - Added brief description, changed file from plain text to tokenised BASIC to prevent it accidentally happening later on
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi
  Programs which need support code to run or trigger math exceptions no longer trigger an undefined instruction abort from within VFPSupport

@Add initial VFPv1/VFPv2 support
Detail:
  s/Module:
  - CheckHardware can now correctly determine that the ARM1176JZF-S is ARMv6, not ARMv7
  - Added initial support for VFPv1/v2; currently only supports implementations that use FSTMX/FLDMX standard format 1, and for which we know we can read the MVFR0/MVFR1 registers. I.e. only VFP11 supported at present.
  - Fixed null pointer dereference in ExamineContext when examining the active context
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi with high processor vectors
  Note there is no support code present, so using the coprocessor outside of RunFast mode will result in aborts.

@Use official error block. Disallow instantiation. Warn clients before finalising.
Detail:
  Resources/UK/Messages, s/Errors, hdr/VFPSupport - Errors now declared in public header. New/updated error messages and symbols.
  s/GetAll - Changed GET order to work with errors in header file
  s/Module - Disallow instantiation. Manually issue Service_ModulePostFinal during finalisation, to give clients slightly more warning than the kernel does.

@Tweak VFPSupport API and add support for contexts stored in application space
Detail:
  s/Module, hdr/VFPSupport - New/changed features:
  - Contexts can now be flagged as being in application space if they're created with the VFPSupport_Context_AppSpace flag
  - VFPSupport_ChangeContext accepts a VFPSupport_ChangeContext_AppSpace flag, which will force the context change to occur in a nonlazy manner if the currently active context is in application space
  - VFPSupport_CreateContext accepts a VFPSupport_CreateContext_LazyActivate flag, to indicate that after creation the context should be activated lazily (unlike VFSupport_CreateContext_Activate)
  - VFPSupport_Context_Activate renamed to VFPSupport_CreateContext_Activate for clarity
  - VFPSupport_CheckContext now ignores the Activate/LazyActivate flags, so the same flag word can be passed to Check & Create
  - "Context ID" simplified to just "Context pointer", as an indiciation of the fact that I now have no plans to make VFPSupport keep a master list of extant contexts
    - This makes it legal for programs to move/copy/delete contexts as long as they've made sure that the ExamineContext doesn't indicate that any part of the context is active
  - VFPSupport_ExamineContext now returns the context size in R4 instead of the context ID
  Test/test1,ffb - Updated to work with new API
Admin:
  Tested on rev A2 BB-xM.
  VFPSupport_ExamineContext change is backwards-incompatible!
