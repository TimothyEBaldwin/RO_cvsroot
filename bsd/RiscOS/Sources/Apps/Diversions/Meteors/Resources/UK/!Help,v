@Get constants from Hdr:WimpSpace not local copy
The file Constants.s was almost redundant, source updated to use Wimp exports.
Fix bug (line 3204) when dragging the game window off the left edge of the screen, the clipping code chopped the top 5 bits off the screen address leading to an all to easy data abort when trying to plot the object.

Version 0.21. Tagged as 'Meteors-0_21'

                                -------

The idea of the game is to knock out all the meteors without colliding with
them. Little meteors, being harder to hit, score more than big ones.

Each new sheet starts with progressively more meteors with higher velocity,
making the game harder still.

If collision is inevitable you can hyperspace to another location, but be
warned that such high speed travel can weaken the space craft's structure.

Controls:

     N - new sheet
     Z - rotate left
     X - rotate right
 Shift - accelerate
 Space - hyperspace to another location
Return - fire
Escape - toggle full screen/windowed view
     P - toggle pause/resume game
