                        =======

Help the frog hop its way to safety across a busy road and over the rapids,
collecting tasty flies along the way. Watch out for the poisonous snake
and hungry crocodile.

Earn extra spare lives for each level completed, though as the levels 
progress the game gets a little harder (more traffic, more snakes, that sort
of thing).

To set up various options for Hopper, select Choices from the icon bar
menu. This brings up a window allowing you to change the control keys, music
and sound effect volume, how the high score table works, whether auto-repeat
is on, and graphics update speed and sound quality.

Four sound quality levels are used, Very High, High, Medium, and Low.
Very High requires more processor power, and hence only recommended for
people with more powerful machines. The rest use less processor as the sound
quality lessens.

Once the iconbar icon is clicked upon, you are taken into Hopper. Pressing
SPACE then begins a game. Pressing ESCAPE returns you back to the desktop.

Other keys:

     ESCAPE quits the game
     F9/F10 pause/unpauses
     F1/F2  turn sound on/off
     F5/F6  turn music on/off

HOPPER
======   1.00 (Dec 3 1996)
         Simon Foster
d4 7
a10 9

This is the final release of my version of Hopper.

Unfortunately samples still need some work, but unfortunately I've tried
by best and hope the ones I've included do the job.


How do you use Hopper?
----------------------
a21 5
The Graphics Update allows you to change how much of the screen is updated in
one frame. Normal is for fast-ish machines, the whole screen is updated in each
frame. Slower is for slower machines, where only 50% of the screen is updated
per frame.

d25 1
a25 16
From the game itself, ESCAPE quits, F9 pauses, and F10 unpauses. That's just
about it.

Oh yes, and you can turn sound on/off using F1/F2, and music on/off using
F5/F6.


Installing an upgrade
---------------------

Simply drag !Hopper from the upgrade archive over the original !Hopper. 
Do _NOT_ delete the original !Hopper.


Versions

         High score name entry completed.
d32 1
a32 29
0.76b    Tested only
         Refined the levels a little, also when the end of the levels 
         is reached the speed is increased for each subsequent level.
         Work started on high score name entry.
         F1/F2 and F5/F6 now work to control sound and music within the
         game.
         
0.71b    Second release
         Graphics flicker removed from slower machines.
         Option to cancel the auto-repeat, hopefully frog moves at the
         same speed regardless of machine speed.
         Option to turn down the sound quality.

0.63b    Initial release


Known bugs
----------

There is one that baffles me. Only once in a blue moon, you can overshoot
the last row of logs and simply float there. Any attempt to move then
loses a life.

Also, on a StrongARM'ed machine Hopper will sometimes hang, I don't know
why as the main application is completely 100% in C. I simply put it down
to the StrongARM as some other applications do the same.

I would especially like to hear from people with older slower machines, to
get an idea of how flickery the graphics are.
