@Internationalised
Adjusted the bevelled borders plotter around the high scores so the bevels join up.
Fix bug in data_load which would report missing files as allocation failures.
Changed to use newly allocated PsychoEffects SWI base (previous one was an allocation clash).
New application sprites from Chris Wraight.
