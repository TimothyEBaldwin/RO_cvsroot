                      ======

This utility will show a breakdown of the processor time 
that each of the running desktop applications is using.

On the icon bar a small graphic will show the rolling 
average of the most recent processor load, and SELECT 
clicking on this graphic will open a bar graph display 
similar to the task manager's display showing memory use
for each desktop application.

The 'idle time' is the fraction of the time the processor 
is doing nothing, that is, no applications are actively 
performing calculations.
