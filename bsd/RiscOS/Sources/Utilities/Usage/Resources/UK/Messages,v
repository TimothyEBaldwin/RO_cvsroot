@Add an extra icon so the column headings line up
Usage's "Task" and "CPU Usage" column headings only lined up in system font because they used spaces for alignment. Split the column headings into 2 icons so they're always in the same place regardless of font.
Rephrase/repunctuate a few of the interactive help messages to follow the style of the other built in apps, eg. no ! before the app name.

Spotted while updating User Guide chapter.

@Import of application !Usage
Special thanks to original author Ran Mokady for permission to release this application and host the sources here.
This import produces the same binary as the original version, though is reorganised slightly to fit within a standard component in CVS.
