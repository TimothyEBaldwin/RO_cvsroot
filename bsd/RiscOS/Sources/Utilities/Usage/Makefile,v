@Generate Usage support module from sources
* 32 bitted the supporting module from a disassembly from !SID, tidied a little by hand
* Produced a !Help note, includes the BSD licence terms
* Insert the version number into the info box at build time
* Adjust the iconbar menu to open at the stipulated 96 OS units up
* Bumped up the wimpslot to 32k
Tested on Beagleboard xM and Risc PC with a variety of apps running.

@Import of application !Usage
Special thanks to original author Ran Mokady for permission to release this application and host the sources here.
This import produces the same binary as the original version, though is reorganised slightly to fit within a standard component in CVS.
