log
@Import SDCreate as a bona fide component
Detail:
  BSD licensed version of SDCreate for packaging into ROM downloads, disc images, etc.
  Functionaly equivalent to V1.21 from www.phlamethrower.co.uk, but can be built as an installable app or forced to install itself during release_autobuild for the benefit of the autobuilder
  This will now be the main home of the SDCreate sources.
Admin:
  Builds OK, but untested at runtime


Version 1.23. Tagged as 'SDCreate-1_23'
