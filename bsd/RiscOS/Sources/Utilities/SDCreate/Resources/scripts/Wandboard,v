@Add output mode for Wandboard SD cards
Detail:
  Add an extra radio icon and supporting code to generate images for a Wandboard target, based on the detail in RiscOS/Sources/HAL/iMx6/s/LowBoot.
  Because the on chip loader looks at specific offsets on the SD card we can't use the same FAT layout and file copy operations that the OMAPs do, instead a special FAT image was created:
    mkdosfs -C -R 16386 -s 2 -S 512 blank,fc8 64260
                  ^        ^  ^               ^
                  |        |  |               +---- same as blank for OMAP
                  |        |  +-------------------- 512B/sector
                  |        +----------------------- 2 sectors per cluster
                  +-------------------------------- 8MB reserved for ROM + 1 for BPB + 1 spare

  then the SDCreate program writes the ROM and CMOS into the reserved area plus a welcome note explaining what's happened.
  FrontEnd Desc/Messages/Templates updated accordingly.
  Permit CMOS files of size 260 (256 + the version footer) as well as 240/244/2052.
Admin:
  Makefile changed to use SQUISH from StdTools fragment.

Version 1.26. Tagged as 'SDCreate-1_26'

@Wandboard
=========

Welcome to RISC OS for the iMx6 (Wandboard).


IMPORTANT
=========

Note that the bootloader built into the ARM processor on the Wandboard looks
for the operating system at a fixed sector address on the SDFS::1 drive.
To keep it fixed at that one place it is stored in hidden sectors that can't
be seen in the Filer, which means to update the ROM you must re-run SDCreate.

The rest of the space is formatted as FAT16 and can be used for any purpose,
for example keeping a backup !Boot application. Beware! Re-running SDCreate
will overwrite the contents of SDFS::1 each time.

This text file can be deleted - it is not required for booting.
