log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
CMHG file inserts version from VersionNum.
Use ensure_irqs_on/irqs_restore from AsmUtils.
Trimmed revision history now the code is in CVS.
Debug switch SHOW_INFO removed - there was no supporting code.
Dozens of minor warning fixups as the shared makefiles have stricter checking enabled by default.
Builds, tested on RISC OS 3.70. 26 bit only.

Version 4.54. Tagged as 'EtherH-4_54'

@Import of EtherH driver for i-cubed/Acorn/DesignIT NIC
Special thanks to Rob Cowell of Design IT for taking the time to locate the sources, and agreeing to them being published. 
This is EtherH 4.52, the last public release. 
Only changes
 - makefile now creates empty dirs (to avoid importing empty dirs into CVS)
 - local copies of Hdr: removed, assembler files point to exported central copies
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.
