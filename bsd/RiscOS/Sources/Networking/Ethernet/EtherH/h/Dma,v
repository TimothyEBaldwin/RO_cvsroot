1.2
log
@Replaced htons and friends with ${INETLIB} ones
Functions max() and min() changed for macros.
Made supporting assembler functions common -> support.s, so the IO sources just manipulate IO.
Unused header file 'int_hndlr.h' removed.
Resolved all the remaining compiler warnings.
File 'dma.c' compiles now, but is unused.
Substituted magic numbers for defines from exported header files where available.
Text for NIC slot 8 is now "Network slot" rather than "Expansion slot 8".
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.

1.1
log
@Makefile recreated from fragments
CMHG file inserts version from VersionNum.
Use ensure_irqs_on/irqs_restore from AsmUtils.
Trimmed revision history now the code is in CVS.
Debug switch SHOW_INFO removed - there was no supporting code.
Dozens of minor warning fixups as the shared makefiles have stricter checking enabled by default.
Builds, tested on RISC OS 3.70. 26 bit only.
