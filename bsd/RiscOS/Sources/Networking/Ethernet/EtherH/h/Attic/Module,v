1.2
log
@Substitute 'mbuf', 'dcistructs', 'types', 'errors' from TCPIPLibs:
Insert version number from VersionNum.
Changed error numbers to use SETDCI4ERRNO(), a few were previously using the wrong offset from 0x20E00.
CMHG now generates a header file.
Textual SWI prefix is now "EtherH" for both EtherH8 and EtherH16 versions, since they use the same SWI base they can't coexist, and to match the prefix declared in the DIB block (slightly irrelevant for an ethernet driver since the DCI interface doesn't use SWI names).
Macro FREEM() replaced with m_freem(), also no longer checks for freeing NULL, since MbufManager does that.
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.

Version 4.53. Tagged as 'EtherH-4_53'

@Import of EtherH driver for i-cubed/Acorn/DesignIT NIC
Special thanks to Rob Cowell of Design IT for taking the time to locate the sources, and agreeing to them being published. 
This is EtherH 4.52, the last public release. 
Only changes
 - makefile now creates empty dirs (to avoid importing empty dirs into CVS)
 - local copies of Hdr: removed, assembler files point to exported central copies
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.
