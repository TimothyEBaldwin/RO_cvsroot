@Recoded MICRODELAY to be processor speed/cache agnostic
Checked on a scope doing groups of 250/125/62us delays with interrupts disabled, wiggling an IO line.
Get podule/MEMC logical addresses from Podule_ReadInfo (falls back to table for pre RISC OS 3.50).

@Replaced htons and friends with ${INETLIB} ones
Functions max() and min() changed for macros.
Made supporting assembler functions common -> support.s, so the IO sources just manipulate IO.
Unused header file 'int_hndlr.h' removed.
Resolved all the remaining compiler warnings.
File 'dma.c' compiles now, but is unused.
Substituted magic numbers for defines from exported header files where available.
Text for NIC slot 8 is now "Network slot" rather than "Expansion slot 8".
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.

@Makefile recreated from fragments
CMHG file inserts version from VersionNum.
Use ensure_irqs_on/irqs_restore from AsmUtils.
Trimmed revision history now the code is in CVS.
Debug switch SHOW_INFO removed - there was no supporting code.
Dozens of minor warning fixups as the shared makefiles have stricter checking enabled by default.
Builds, tested on RISC OS 3.70. 26 bit only.

@Substitute 'mbuf', 'dcistructs', 'types', 'errors' from TCPIPLibs:
Insert version number from VersionNum.
Changed error numbers to use SETDCI4ERRNO(), a few were previously using the wrong offset from 0x20E00.
CMHG now generates a header file.
Textual SWI prefix is now "EtherH" for both EtherH8 and EtherH16 versions, since they use the same SWI base they can't coexist, and to match the prefix declared in the DIB block (slightly irrelevant for an ethernet driver since the DCI interface doesn't use SWI names).
Macro FREEM() replaced with m_freem(), also no longer checks for freeing NULL, since MbufManager does that.
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.

@Import of EtherH driver for i-cubed/Acorn/DesignIT NIC
Special thanks to Rob Cowell of Design IT for taking the time to locate the sources, and agreeing to them being published. 
This is EtherH 4.52, the last public release. 
Only changes
 - makefile now creates empty dirs (to avoid importing empty dirs into CVS)
 - local copies of Hdr: removed, assembler files point to exported central copies
Builds but not tested. 26 bit only.
