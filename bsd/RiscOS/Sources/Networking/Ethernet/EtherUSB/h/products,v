@Uses common USB header files exported by the USB stack.
Use ModHand/Variables/RISCOS/OsByte headers.
Note, this has meant some header files needed reordering to prevent circular dependencies.

@Import of sources to EtherUSB.
Special thanks to James Peacock for allowing ROOL to host these sources.
This import represents version 0.13 by James and the backend contributors, the only change being that the makefile wipes the directories it creates on cleaning so there's no need to import those to CVS.
