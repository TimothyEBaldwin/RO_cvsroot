@Add SMSC78xx support
Detail:
  c/smsc78xx, c/module, c/products, h/backends, Makefile - Add SMSC78xx driver, for the chip used in the Raspberry Pi 3B+
  c/config, c/mii, h/mii - Add support for gigabit MIIs & associated (auto) configuration
  c/net, h/net - Handle gigabit link types. Pass verbose flag through to backend info function.
  c/smsc95xx - Make configure_link const-correct
  Resources/UK/CmdHelp - Update *EJConfig syntaxt text to include 1000 option
  Resources/UK/Messages - Add 78xx backend name & device-specific info tokens
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 3B & 3B+
  Manually configured gigabit links aren't supported yet
  Gigabit half-duplex isn't supported (78xx MAC limitation)
  For the 78xx, manually-configured full-duplex links appear to suffer terrible RX performance (as seen on 95xx). All supported auto modes appear to work correctly.

@  Support ARMv8
Detail:
  This module previously used both SWP and SWPB instructions, which have
  been withdrawn in ARMv8. Now use SyncLib to provide the equivalent
  functionality, which will use LDREX/STREX or LDREXB/STREXB instead when
  appropriate.

  Tested on Raspberry Pi 3.

@Save 4.5kB by making the table of errors with objasm (so they're not all padded to 252 bytes by the compiler to fit into _kernel_oserror structs).
The 'moduleerr.s' source should be made redundant by internationalising the module.

log
@Added autosense, and autosense install rule to makefile.
Now uses AsmUtils for irqs_on/irqs_off
Squash a few unused variable warnings, not in the backends though as porting updates would be more complex for those that come from (for example) NetBSD.
Changed to use structure definitions from sys/dcistructs.h (mostly an exercise in prefixing member names).
