@Import of EtherB driver for ANT NIC
This is a clean room reimplementation of the EtherB driver, as the sources are long since lost in the mists of time.
Based on the SEEQ8005 driver from NetBSD it has a few extra changes (demarked by 'RISCOS')
* Some power on self test (configured with *CONFIGURE ETHERB <option>)
* Support for a virtual interface, and seperate stats collection
* Allows up to 8 packets in flight so the dead time while waiting for the hardware to send one packet is used to copy in the next
Tested with a NIC fitted with a SEEQ80C04 and with SEEQ80C04A.
In theory a SEEQ8005 should work, but this has not been tested due to lack of available chips - they were discontinued in 1992, and all samples of ANT NICs seem to be 80C04 or 80C04A based.
