@Some tidy ups, and fix for mbuf loop on fragmented packet
ebmodule.c:
When killing the module, make sure the driver linked callback is removed.
Slight simplification of debug printf, and excess UNUSED().
glue.c:
On fast machines if you're unlucky while sending out a fragmented packet which has been provided as a list of mbufs length > 1, having sent the first chain in the list by using CAT() the chain is free'd but without cropping the hdr off which now points to a free'd mbuf. An incoming packet just at that moment would likely recycle the mbuf and the result is a circular linked list which MbufManager can't process. Unlink hdr before freeing to break the chain.
Non functional comment/variable declarations to make diffing with EtherY/EtherCPSW easier.
glue.h:
Remove unused structure member to save memory.

@Import of EtherB driver for ANT NIC
This is a clean room reimplementation of the EtherB driver, as the sources are long since lost in the mists of time.
Based on the SEEQ8005 driver from NetBSD it has a few extra changes (demarked by 'RISCOS')
* Some power on self test (configured with *CONFIGURE ETHERB <option>)
* Support for a virtual interface, and seperate stats collection
* Allows up to 8 packets in flight so the dead time while waiting for the hardware to send one packet is used to copy in the next
Tested with a NIC fitted with a SEEQ80C04 and with SEEQ80C04A.
In theory a SEEQ8005 should work, but this has not been tested due to lack of available chips - they were discontinued in 1992, and all samples of ANT NICs seem to be 80C04 or 80C04A based.
