@EtherB NIC
----------
Fitted with 80C04 or 80C04A
 BUSMODE = 1 (uses Intel style nCS/nRD/nWR strobes)
 BUSSIZE = 1 (but is software detected anyway)
 nFFEA = 0   (full feature)

The nADUPLEX pin 21 is floating, therefore although the 80C04A has AutoDUPLEX technology (TM) the driver cannot use this. Therefore the stats always report half duplex, and the NetBSD driver declares as simplex, and RX_TX_DISABLE is set in config register 2.

Survey of option links

J2 -> NIC header A13 (LA9)
J3 -> NIC header C13 (LA8)
J4 -> NIC header A12 (LA7)
J5 -> LONG on 83C94, selecting between 5V or 0V. When high (5V) this increases
      the receive sensitivity so cables longer than 100m can be used.

                     |

With a 27C256 EPROM, there are only 28 pins, so the state of J2 & J3 don't matter. J4 must be in the 5V position since pin E30 becomes the Vcc pin on the installed chip.

With a 27C010 EPROM, E30 is no connect, E31 is nPGM, E1 is Vpp, so all three jumpers should be in the 5V position.

@Import of EtherB driver for ANT NIC
This is a clean room reimplementation of the EtherB driver, as the sources are long since lost in the mists of time.
Based on the SEEQ8005 driver from NetBSD it has a few extra changes (demarked by 'RISCOS')
* Some power on self test (configured with *CONFIGURE ETHERB <option>)
* Support for a virtual interface, and seperate stats collection
* Allows up to 8 packets in flight so the dead time while waiting for the hardware to send one packet is used to copy in the next
Tested with a NIC fitted with a SEEQ80C04 and with SEEQ80C04A.
In theory a SEEQ8005 should work, but this has not been tested due to lack of available chips - they were discontinued in 1992, and all samples of ANT NICs seem to be 80C04 or 80C04A based.
