@Import of MimeMap sources
This is an ANT API compatible set of sources to the MimeMap module.
Notable differences being
* Messages and errors are now internationalised
* Now returns an error for out of range SWIs
* Now returns an error when asked to do conversions it doesn't know about
* Returning a string type where the buffer isn't word aligned no longer data aborts on platforms with alignment exceptions
* A lookup requiring a valid RISC OS type no longer returns -2 when the MimeMap file contained an invalid RISC OS type
* Moved previously undocumented type 4 conversion (MMM_TYPE_DOT_EXTNS) to 5, to avoid clash with ROL version which uses type 4 for Apple Mac type/creator pairs
