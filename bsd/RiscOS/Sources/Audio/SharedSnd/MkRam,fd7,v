@Fix to work properly when built into ROM images
Detail:
  Makefile - Rewritten to use assembler makefile fragments instead of C ones. The component is listed as assembler in ModuleDB, so using the C fragments was causing an object file to be linked into the ROM instead of a module.
  MkRam,fd7 - Made to work with new makefile
  s/FillCode, s/Handler, s/Memory, s/Module, s/Vars - Removed dependency on relocation code. It looks like it was only the pointers in FILLCODE_table_start that were being relocated. The fillcode table is now stored in the workspace instead of within the module.
Admin:
  Tested in OMAP3 & Tungsten ROMs.
  Some of the disabled switches may still rely on the removed relocation code.

@  Import of version 1.00 of SharedSound from WSS - this is a merge of
  RISC OS Ltd, ESP and Pace sources. I've added the Makefile, Mk* and
  VersionNum files.

Detail (courtesy of WSS):
  * Incorporates fixes made to 0.58c to fix the callbacks on sound
    rate changes.

  * Incorporates RISC OS Ltd changes to response to
    TaskManager_Acknowledgements service.

  * Includes 8 bit Log and PowerWave drivers.

  * Now built with Objasm, not BASIC assembler.

  * SharedSound_HandlerInfo SWI fixed to conform to spec. Also
    extended to accept r0 = 0 on entry, in which case r0 = number of
    first registered handler (or 0 for none) on exit; R1-R5 corrupted.

    Therefore the following code enumerates handlers:

    REM Get first handler number.
    SYS "SharedSound_HandlerInfo",0 TO next% ; flags%
    REM While no errors, and not finished
    WHILE (next% <> 0) AND ((flags% AND 1) = 0)
     SYS"SharedSound_HandlerInfo",next% TO next%,a%,b%,c%,d%,e%
    ENDWHILE

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 6 (SharedSound Starting)
    on (callback after) initialisation.

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 7 (SharedSound Dying)
    on finalisation.

  * Some small optimisations

  * Version bumped to 1.00 (to allow RISC OS Ltd space to make changes
    to their versions).

  * Table of helpful fill code routines now passed to handlers in R8.

  * SharedSound reinitialises correctly on lower layers reinitialising.

  * More care taken to remove outstanding callbacks on finalise.

  * Dual 26/32 bit version.

Admin:
  * Not tested by us.

  * 8-bit sound system code is known not to be ROM safe. However, it is
    currently switched out (see the doLog option in s.Gets).

  * This version *will not work* on a 32-bit system. There are at least two
    issues with it that I've spotted with a quick glance through the code -
    the lack of the module flags word, and an unconditional TEQP instruction.
    This version has been checked in nevertheless as a record of what WSS
    delivered to us.

@Import of latest sources from ESP.
This represents ESP's version 1.06 (14 May 2002). The files are exactly as
received, but they are not expected to build as they are against the public
headers.

1.3
log
@Changed things so that the detokenised BASIC source (in the c directory) has
no line numbers present (LISTO 8). The detokenised source's raison d'etre is
to allow easier CVS diffs, but line numbers would defeat this purpose whenever
the change involves inserting more than a handful of line numbers.

No other changes - this version is committed and tagged purely as a reference
point for future updates. Tag used is 'bavison_SharedSnd-0_48'.
