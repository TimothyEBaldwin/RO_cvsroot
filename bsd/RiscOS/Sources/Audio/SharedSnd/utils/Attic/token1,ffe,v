log
@  Import of version 1.00 of SharedSound from WSS - this is a merge of
  RISC OS Ltd, ESP and Pace sources. I've added the Makefile, Mk* and
  VersionNum files.

Detail (courtesy of WSS):
  * Incorporates fixes made to 0.58c to fix the callbacks on sound
    rate changes.

  * Incorporates RISC OS Ltd changes to response to
    TaskManager_Acknowledgements service.

  * Includes 8 bit Log and PowerWave drivers.

  * Now built with Objasm, not BASIC assembler.

  * SharedSound_HandlerInfo SWI fixed to conform to spec. Also
    extended to accept r0 = 0 on entry, in which case r0 = number of
    first registered handler (or 0 for none) on exit; R1-R5 corrupted.

    Therefore the following code enumerates handlers:

    REM Get first handler number.
    SYS "SharedSound_HandlerInfo",0 TO next% ; flags%
    REM While no errors, and not finished
    WHILE (next% <> 0) AND ((flags% AND 1) = 0)
     SYS"SharedSound_HandlerInfo",next% TO next%,a%,b%,c%,d%,e%
    ENDWHILE

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 6 (SharedSound Starting)
    on (callback after) initialisation.

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 7 (SharedSound Dying)
    on finalisation.

  * Some small optimisations

  * Version bumped to 1.00 (to allow RISC OS Ltd space to make changes
    to their versions).

  * Table of helpful fill code routines now passed to handlers in R8.

  * SharedSound reinitialises correctly on lower layers reinitialising.

  * More care taken to remove outstanding callbacks on finalise.

  * Dual 26/32 bit version.

Admin:
  * Not tested by us.

  * 8-bit sound system code is known not to be ROM safe. However, it is
    currently switched out (see the doLog option in s.Gets).

  * This version *will not work* on a 32-bit system. There are at least two
    issues with it that I've spotted with a quick glance through the code -
    the lack of the module flags word, and an unconditional TEQP instruction.
    This version has been checked in nevertheless as a record of what WSS
    delivered to us.
