@Use Entry/EXIT, Push/Pull macros
Detail:
  s/* - Code updated to use Entry/EXIT and Push/Pull macros where possible instead of manual STM/LDM. Also add ROUTs for safety (although most routines use named local labels rather than numbered ones). A few obvious cases also fixed to reduce number of regs pushed onto stack.
  A few other changes and fixes of note:
  s/Log - Trim empty, unused installLogDriver routine when doLog is {FALSE}
  s/Module - Add a veneer to swiHandler to deal with 26bit and 26/32bit neutral cases; avoids the need for individual SWI handlers to preserve NZC
  s/SWIs:
  - Remove 26/32bit neutral SWI exit code, now handled by veneers. CLRV on most SWI exits to replace the implicit CLRV from CMP pc,pc.
  - swiHandlerVolume and swiDriverMixer were popping the wrong regs from the stack for most error cases; now fixed via the switch to Entry/EXIT
Admin:
  Tested on Raspberry Pi

@Internationalised
Errors are now looked up via MessageTrans.
The driver names (registered via InstallDriver or to SoundDriver_Install) are now also looked up.
Note, the SharedSound_DriverInfo SWI used to return r2 as the pointer to a pointer to the name, the documentation seems vague as to what the intent was, but it seems more likely that a pointer to the name was what was intended. The name string is buffered (because it needs looking up for internationalisation anyway).

Tested briefly, inspecting the workspace for name lookups and sending a fake Service_SoundDriver service call. Two errors deliberatly triggered to check error text.

Detail:
  A few of these were careless typos, others were already X SWIs but the
  symbol names didn't reflect the fact, and in other cases there was no code
  path to deal with error cases. All now fixed. Also fixed all the assembly
  time warnings (at least for 32-bit ROM builds).

@  Selective merge of ESP's version 1.06 (14 May 2002) of SharedSound.
Detail:
  Changelog not provided by ESP. I have made an additional change to use
  the value of SoundSystemNIL from Hdr:Sound to test if SoundChannels is not
  installed - this constant changed in RISC OS 5 for 32-bitting reasons.
Admin:
  Builds, and briefly tested. Coincidentally, this is also our version 1.06.

1.1
log
@  Import of version 1.00 of SharedSound from WSS - this is a merge of
  RISC OS Ltd, ESP and Pace sources. I've added the Makefile, Mk* and
  VersionNum files.

Detail (courtesy of WSS):
  * Incorporates fixes made to 0.58c to fix the callbacks on sound
    rate changes.

  * Incorporates RISC OS Ltd changes to response to
    TaskManager_Acknowledgements service.

  * Includes 8 bit Log and PowerWave drivers.

  * Now built with Objasm, not BASIC assembler.

  * SharedSound_HandlerInfo SWI fixed to conform to spec. Also
    extended to accept r0 = 0 on entry, in which case r0 = number of
    first registered handler (or 0 for none) on exit; R1-R5 corrupted.

    Therefore the following code enumerates handlers:

    REM Get first handler number.
    SYS "SharedSound_HandlerInfo",0 TO next% ; flags%
    REM While no errors, and not finished
    WHILE (next% <> 0) AND ((flags% AND 1) = 0)
     SYS"SharedSound_HandlerInfo",next% TO next%,a%,b%,c%,d%,e%
    ENDWHILE

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 6 (SharedSound Starting)
    on (callback after) initialisation.

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 7 (SharedSound Dying)
    on finalisation.

  * Some small optimisations

  * Version bumped to 1.00 (to allow RISC OS Ltd space to make changes
    to their versions).

  * Table of helpful fill code routines now passed to handlers in R8.

  * SharedSound reinitialises correctly on lower layers reinitialising.

  * More care taken to remove outstanding callbacks on finalise.

  * Dual 26/32 bit version.

Admin:
  * Not tested by us.

  * 8-bit sound system code is known not to be ROM safe. However, it is
    currently switched out (see the doLog option in s.Gets).

  * This version *will not work* on a 32-bit system. There are at least two
    issues with it that I've spotted with a quick glance through the code -
    the lack of the module flags word, and an unconditional TEQP instruction.
    This version has been checked in nevertheless as a record of what WSS
    delivered to us.

Version 1.00. Tagged as 'SharedSnd-1_00'

@Import of latest sources from ESP.
This represents ESP's version 1.06 (14 May 2002). The files are exactly as
received, but they are not expected to build as they are against the public
headers.
