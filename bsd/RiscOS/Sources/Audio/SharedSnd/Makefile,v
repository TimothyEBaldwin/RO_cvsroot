@Internationalised
Errors are now looked up via MessageTrans.
The driver names (registered via InstallDriver or to SoundDriver_Install) are now also looked up.
Note, the SharedSound_DriverInfo SWI used to return r2 as the pointer to a pointer to the name, the documentation seems vague as to what the intent was, but it seems more likely that a pointer to the name was what was intended. The name string is buffered (because it needs looking up for internationalisation anyway).

Tested briefly, inspecting the workspace for name lookups and sending a fake Service_SoundDriver service call. Two errors deliberatly triggered to check error text.

@Fix to work properly when built into ROM images
Detail:
  Makefile - Rewritten to use assembler makefile fragments instead of C ones. The component is listed as assembler in ModuleDB, so using the C fragments was causing an object file to be linked into the ROM instead of a module.
  MkRam,fd7 - Made to work with new makefile
  s/FillCode, s/Handler, s/Memory, s/Module, s/Vars - Removed dependency on relocation code. It looks like it was only the pointers in FILLCODE_table_start that were being relocated. The fillcode table is now stored in the workspace instead of within the module.
Admin:
  Tested in OMAP3 & Tungsten ROMs.
  Some of the disabled switches may still rely on the removed relocation code.

@  Import of version 1.00 of SharedSound from WSS - this is a merge of
  RISC OS Ltd, ESP and Pace sources. I've added the Makefile, Mk* and
  VersionNum files.

Detail (courtesy of WSS):
  * Incorporates fixes made to 0.58c to fix the callbacks on sound
    rate changes.

  * Incorporates RISC OS Ltd changes to response to
    TaskManager_Acknowledgements service.

  * Includes 8 bit Log and PowerWave drivers.

  * Now built with Objasm, not BASIC assembler.

  * SharedSound_HandlerInfo SWI fixed to conform to spec. Also
    extended to accept r0 = 0 on entry, in which case r0 = number of
    first registered handler (or 0 for none) on exit; R1-R5 corrupted.

    Therefore the following code enumerates handlers:

    REM Get first handler number.
    SYS "SharedSound_HandlerInfo",0 TO next% ; flags%
    REM While no errors, and not finished
    WHILE (next% <> 0) AND ((flags% AND 1) = 0)
     SYS"SharedSound_HandlerInfo",next% TO next%,a%,b%,c%,d%,e%
    ENDWHILE

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 6 (SharedSound Starting)
    on (callback after) initialisation.

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 7 (SharedSound Dying)
    on finalisation.

  * Some small optimisations

  * Version bumped to 1.00 (to allow RISC OS Ltd space to make changes
    to their versions).

  * Table of helpful fill code routines now passed to handlers in R8.

  * SharedSound reinitialises correctly on lower layers reinitialising.

  * More care taken to remove outstanding callbacks on finalise.

  * Dual 26/32 bit version.

Admin:
  * Not tested by us.

  * 8-bit sound system code is known not to be ROM safe. However, it is
    currently switched out (see the doLog option in s.Gets).

  * This version *will not work* on a 32-bit system. There are at least two
    issues with it that I've spotted with a quick glance through the code -
    the lack of the module flags word, and an unconditional TEQP instruction.
    This version has been checked in nevertheless as a record of what WSS
    delivered to us.

@New version: useful changes are bug fixed in removing callback
handlers (affects turning off the MIDI synth), and maintains number of

of RealAudio playback from fluctuating when MIDI Synth can't make its

Other changes adds CBAI and 8bit log output support (disabled) and
