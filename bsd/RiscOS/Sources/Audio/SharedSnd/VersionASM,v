@Use PSR manipulation macros. Macroise driver calling. Simplify error checks.
Detail:
  s/Drivers - Macroise driver calling to reduce amount of duplicate code. Also avoid NOP if storing PC stores PC+8 and not PC+12.
  s/Handler - Use PSR manipulation macros for switching modes and controlling IRQs. Remove redundant IRQ disabling around atomic store of one word in doHandlerCallBack.
  s/Module - Use PSR manipulation macros for switching modes
  s/SWIS - Simplify range checking on handler and driver numbers; treat as unsigned numbers instead of signed.
  s/Vars - Remove local definitions of IRQ flags & SVC mode

@Use Entry/EXIT, Push/Pull macros
Detail:
  s/* - Code updated to use Entry/EXIT and Push/Pull macros where possible instead of manual STM/LDM. Also add ROUTs for safety (although most routines use named local labels rather than numbered ones). A few obvious cases also fixed to reduce number of regs pushed onto stack.
  A few other changes and fixes of note:
  s/Log - Trim empty, unused installLogDriver routine when doLog is {FALSE}
  s/Module - Add a veneer to swiHandler to deal with 26bit and 26/32bit neutral cases; avoids the need for individual SWI handlers to preserve NZC
  s/SWIs:
  - Remove 26/32bit neutral SWI exit code, now handled by veneers. CLRV on most SWI exits to replace the implicit CLRV from CMP pc,pc.
  - swiHandlerVolume and swiDriverMixer were popping the wrong regs from the stack for most error cases; now fixed via the switch to Entry/EXIT

@Internationalised
Errors are now looked up via MessageTrans.
The driver names (registered via InstallDriver or to SoundDriver_Install) are now also looked up.
Note, the SharedSound_DriverInfo SWI used to return r2 as the pointer to a pointer to the name, the documentation seems vague as to what the intent was, but it seems more likely that a pointer to the name was what was intended. The name string is buffered (because it needs looking up for internationalisation anyway).

Tested briefly, inspecting the workspace for name lookups and sending a fake Service_SoundDriver service call. Two errors deliberatly triggered to check error text.

@Fix for zombie callback loop after killing SharedSound
When the sound system is reinitialised, but SoundChannels not yet started, SharedSound books a callback 40cs in the future to retry.
When used with an 8 bit sound system this occurs repeatedly (in the hope that a 16 bit linear handler will become available) but on RMKILL the callback was not cancelled - so although the module is dead a pair of zombie callbacks keep booking & trying, booking & trying.
* Finalise handler now cancels the 40cs ticker event
* Played safe and changed the CMP of the handler addresses (clearing V) to CLRV
* Added some asserts to the service table
* Removed some unnecessary NOP's after MOV lr, pc operations.

Tested in IOMD ROM.

@Fix to work properly when built into ROM images
Detail:
  Makefile - Rewritten to use assembler makefile fragments instead of C ones. The component is listed as assembler in ModuleDB, so using the C fragments was causing an object file to be linked into the ROM instead of a module.
  MkRam,fd7 - Made to work with new makefile
  s/FillCode, s/Handler, s/Memory, s/Module, s/Vars - Removed dependency on relocation code. It looks like it was only the pointers in FILLCODE_table_start that were being relocated. The fillcode table is now stored in the workspace instead of within the module.
Admin:
  Tested in OMAP3 & Tungsten ROMs.
  Some of the disabled switches may still rely on the removed relocation code.

1.2
log
@  Module scrutinised for problems, and many found and fixed.
Detail:
  * Module flags word and header entry reinstated.
  * Many exits from SWIs had lost their 32-bit compatibility.
  * Unconditional TEQP made conditional, and an MSR replaced with an MRS.
  * A few unnecessary mode checks and alternate returns simplified because
    transient callbacks and 8-bit fill code have never needed to preserve
    processor flags.
  * Driver mixer calling bug fixed again.
  * Spelling and grammatical errors in comments and error messages re-fixed.
  * Other insignificant stuff.
Admin:
  Still untested, but worth trying in a 32-bit build now.

1.1
log
@  Import of version 1.00 of SharedSound from WSS - this is a merge of
  RISC OS Ltd, ESP and Pace sources. I've added the Makefile, Mk* and
  VersionNum files.

Detail (courtesy of WSS):
  * Incorporates fixes made to 0.58c to fix the callbacks on sound
    rate changes.

  * Incorporates RISC OS Ltd changes to response to
    TaskManager_Acknowledgements service.

  * Includes 8 bit Log and PowerWave drivers.

  * Now built with Objasm, not BASIC assembler.

  * SharedSound_HandlerInfo SWI fixed to conform to spec. Also
    extended to accept r0 = 0 on entry, in which case r0 = number of
    first registered handler (or 0 for none) on exit; R1-R5 corrupted.

    Therefore the following code enumerates handlers:

    REM Get first handler number.
    SYS "SharedSound_HandlerInfo",0 TO next% ; flags%
    REM While no errors, and not finished
    WHILE (next% <> 0) AND ((flags% AND 1) = 0)
     SYS"SharedSound_HandlerInfo",next% TO next%,a%,b%,c%,d%,e%
    ENDWHILE

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 6 (SharedSound Starting)
    on (callback after) initialisation.

  * Sends Service_Sound (&54) with reason code 7 (SharedSound Dying)
    on finalisation.

  * Some small optimisations

  * Version bumped to 1.00 (to allow RISC OS Ltd space to make changes
    to their versions).

  * Table of helpful fill code routines now passed to handlers in R8.

  * SharedSound reinitialises correctly on lower layers reinitialising.

  * More care taken to remove outstanding callbacks on finalise.

  * Dual 26/32 bit version.

Admin:
  * Not tested by us.

  * 8-bit sound system code is known not to be ROM safe. However, it is
    currently switched out (see the doLog option in s.Gets).

  * This version *will not work* on a 32-bit system. There are at least two
    issues with it that I've spotted with a quick glance through the code -
    the lack of the module flags word, and an unconditional TEQP instruction.
    This version has been checked in nevertheless as a record of what WSS
    delivered to us.
