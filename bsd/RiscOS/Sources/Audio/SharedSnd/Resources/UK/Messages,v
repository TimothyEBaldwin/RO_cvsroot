1.1
log
@Internationalised
Errors are now looked up via MessageTrans.
The driver names (registered via InstallDriver or to SoundDriver_Install) are now also looked up.
Note, the SharedSound_DriverInfo SWI used to return r2 as the pointer to a pointer to the name, the documentation seems vague as to what the intent was, but it seems more likely that a pointer to the name was what was intended. The name string is buffered (because it needs looking up for internationalisation anyway).

Tested briefly, inspecting the workspace for name lookups and sending a fake Service_SoundDriver service call. Two errors deliberatly triggered to check error text.

Version 1.15. Tagged as 'SharedSnd-1_15'
