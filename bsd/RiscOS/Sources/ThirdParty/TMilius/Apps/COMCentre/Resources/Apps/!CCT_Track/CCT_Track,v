@!CCT_Track added to COMCentre
Detail:
!CCT_Track logs changes of communications cells into a file.
It also allows to try to show your actual location on small maps
provided by OSM URL-concept based map providers. To determine the
location from cellID and LAC it uses OpenCellID or OpenBMap information.
