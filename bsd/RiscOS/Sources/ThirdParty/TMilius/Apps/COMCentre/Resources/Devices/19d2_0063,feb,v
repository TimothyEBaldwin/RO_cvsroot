@Various Improvements to COMCentre
Detail:
  Some error corrections
  New sprite for CCT_PNums
  Keyboard Shortcuts should work now
  Introdution of URCSplit allowing using Internet and Phone functions in
  parallel. This ended up in rewriting lots of code.
  Huawei and ZTE Devices changed to URCSplit access
  Introduction of CCT_Phone. Only supported function in the moment is
  "dailing" of USSD and displaying the responses.
