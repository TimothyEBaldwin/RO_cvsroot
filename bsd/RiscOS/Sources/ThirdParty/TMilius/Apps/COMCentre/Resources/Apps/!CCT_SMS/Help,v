    CCT_SMS
===========================================================================

After choosing a communication device from the drop down list the SMS stred
on the SIM card/device are displayed. You write your own SMS and send it to
an arbitrary phone number which can handle SMS. The SMS you sent yourself are
stored inside a log file. 

New SMS may (!) be added automatically to the end of the list.

NOTE: Gathering the list of connections traditionally takes a while.
