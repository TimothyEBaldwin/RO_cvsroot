@For COMCentre consists of a couple of more or minor files it doesn't make
sense to spent most Bytes for repeating the licenses every time. So the
licenses are located here and inside the programs/files you will find an
according hint.

In general COMCentre is free programm in sense of the BSD license. However be
aware that parts that parts of it are using like the !Routines library of
Steve Revill and AppBasic or certain required modules may underly other kind of licenses and so you have to check under which terms you can copy and use these parts of software. Note also that COMCentre is a root for a collection of routines. It may happen that someone provides you an addition which
installs inside COMCentre which underlies different licenses.

COMCentre was written by Thomas Milius, Germany. Sprites are provided by Raik
Fischer, Germany.
