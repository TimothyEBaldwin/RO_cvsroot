After choosing a communication device from the drop down list you can set up
some configuration for it.

The first section covers settings for the internet connection. You can either
choose settings from a preconfigured tarif or setup teh provider name and
name servers directly. You can also also/disallow roaming for internet
access. Note that possibly required account/password settings needs to be
configure inside according PPP files inside the !Internet setup.

You can also select at which locations phonenumbers and SMS are stored. You
can keep the actual configured storage or determine to store the data on SIM
card or inside the device.

Afterwards save your settings for usage.

The second section allows you to lock/enable a couple of features directly on
the device. Therefore you will require your PIN.
