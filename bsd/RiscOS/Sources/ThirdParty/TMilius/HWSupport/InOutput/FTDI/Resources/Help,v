@FTDI is an electronic chip manufacturer which produces chips
which are providing an USB to serial/parallel Interface.

The chips are small and easy to program (FTDI delivers the according
driver for Windows). In last consequences an USB devices can be
used as if it would be a serial/parallel device. So especally
manufacturers of computer devices which provided a serial interface
simply added one of the FTDI chip to their devices so that the devices
are now providing an USB interface instaed of a serial one but
the software can be used for both devices versions without change.

There are lots of useful USB devices based on the FTDI chips.
This driver is an RISC OS pendant to the original FTDI driver to
allow to use such devices under RISC OS.

Note the following:
1. This driver is limited compared to the original FTDI driver.
   It is not authorized by FTDI. However there is no authorized driver
   from FTDI for RISC OS so it may be better then nothing.
2. No guarantee is taken that an FTDI chip based device will work
   with this driver. So if you are buying such a device you are buying
   it on your own risk. Don't blame the device manufacturer or FTDI
   if you can't get the device working under RISC OS.
3. I am taking no resposibility that this driver won't damage your device.
   Using your device with this driver is entirely on your own risk.
4. Read the device configuration remarks carefully.
5. This driver implements only a simple serial layer for I/O to the USB
   device. This means you will require another driver/program etc.
   to run the device which can cope with the device specific protocol.

The driver is freeware and open source.
