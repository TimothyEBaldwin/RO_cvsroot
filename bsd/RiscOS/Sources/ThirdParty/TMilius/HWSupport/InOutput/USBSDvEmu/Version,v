@  Improve USBSDVEmu to cope better with actual RISC OS 5.19 version
  and minor improvements in special cases
Detail:
  Performs now an implicit USB fetch in case that all Bytes are read
  from the buffer because OS Upcall 9 seems to fail in such cases
  sometimes.
  In case that accidentally Bytes are received during an USB fetch they
  are reinsert into the buffers instead dropped as before.
  The USB fetch has got a reentrancy protection
