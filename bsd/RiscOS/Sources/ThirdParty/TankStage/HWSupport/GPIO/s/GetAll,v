@Transition Pi HAL to API 1.00
Detail:
  Add extra definitions and structure layouts to GPIODevice header. Remove local inclusion of Hdr:HALDevice, in line with the other HAL device headers (BMU, Mixer, RTC, et al).
  Remove GPIOType/Revision definitions for Pi.
  Switch out the Pi machine checks in the module so it still builds.
Admin:
  GPIO module built, but not tested.

@Implementation of API 1.00
Detail:
  By delagating the hardware access element to the underlying HAL, the GPIO module becomes much simpler.
  None of the platform specific SWIs (eg. GPIO_AuxAsUSB) are required, or implemented. This information can be obtained by enumerating the pins and switching members of the same group by setting their mode for example.
  A new SWI, GPIO_Features is added, though the returned flags are currently 0 the presence of the SWI demarks the HAL variant.
  A new command, *GPIODevices lists the GPIO controller(s) known and their basic input/output state at a glance.
  See the StrongHelp manual for full details.
Admin:
  Tested on not-a-Pi too, to ensure it doesn't attach to pre API 1.00.
