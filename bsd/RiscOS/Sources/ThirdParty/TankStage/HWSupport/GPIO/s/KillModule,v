@Use Push/Pull macros
This gets rid of ~200 mixed UAL warnings without having to use the -nowarn switch, which could hide some genuine warnings needing attention.
PUSH and POP are synonyms for their STM and LDM equivalent, according to the ARM ARM.
Version number bumped to +0.01 greater than Tank's latest binary.

1.5.2.1
log
@Implementation of API 1.00
Detail:
  By delagating the hardware access element to the underlying HAL, the GPIO module becomes much simpler.
  None of the platform specific SWIs (eg. GPIO_AuxAsUSB) are required, or implemented. This information can be obtained by enumerating the pins and switching members of the same group by setting their mode for example.
  A new SWI, GPIO_Features is added, though the returned flags are currently 0 the presence of the SWI demarks the HAL variant.
  A new command, *GPIODevices lists the GPIO controller(s) known and their basic input/output state at a glance.
  See the StrongHelp manual for full details.
Admin:
  Tested on not-a-Pi too, to ensure it doesn't attach to pre API 1.00.

@Post review fixups
Unknown SWIs now return the error with V set rather than calling OS_GenerateError.
A couple of non-X SWIs changed added 'X'.
Use SETV/CLRV now we have sight of central headers to simplify the exit points.
Query use of SWIEQ/SWINE pair.
