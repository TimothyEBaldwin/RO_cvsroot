1.1.2.1
log
@Implementation of API 1.00
Detail:
  By delagating the hardware access element to the underlying HAL, the GPIO module becomes much simpler.
  None of the platform specific SWIs (eg. GPIO_AuxAsUSB) are required, or implemented. This information can be obtained by enumerating the pins and switching members of the same group by setting their mode for example.
  A new SWI, GPIO_Features is added, though the returned flags are currently 0 the presence of the SWI demarks the HAL variant.
  A new command, *GPIODevices lists the GPIO controller(s) known and their basic input/output state at a glance.
  See the StrongHelp manual for full details.
Admin:
  Tested on not-a-Pi too, to ensure it doesn't attach to pre API 1.00.

Version 1.00, 1.11.2.1. Tagged as 'GPIO-1_00-1_11_2_1'
