@OMAP4 tweaks and fixes
Detail:
  c/cmodule - Debug code updated to use new register names
  h/dss - Remove regmf field from clock_divider_t
  h/regs3 - Correct typo in OVERLAY_ATTRIBUTES register field
  h/regs4 - Rename many registers to match the name used in the OMAP4 TRM (previously used OMAP3 naming due to shared code being used for both chips). Fix the occasional mistake. Also removed configuration4 register from DSI PLL (not mentioned in recent TRMs)
  omap4/c/dispc_plat - Updated for new register names
  omap4/c/dsi - Remove setting of DSI PLL configuration4 register
  omap4/c/dss - Update for new register names. Removal of regm4 from clock_divider_t. Update FIFO configuration so that the larger WB FIFO is used instead of the GFX one.
  omap4/c/omap - Update for new register names and FIFO setup. Fix omap4_vetmode_ldc2() returning true for invalid widths instead of false.

@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.

@Merge of OMAP3 and OMAP4 video driver sources.
With 85%+ shared code, tracking changes between these two modules was getting complicated, so now this single module will serve both OMAP3 targets and OMAP4.
At present, the differences are simply selected at compile time with a switch. This may make sense to further rationalise either with tidier macros or run time detection (since the HAL knows which controller is running).
Tested on OMAP3 in all 8 colour depths,
Tested by Willi Theiss on OMAP4.

@Merge of headers with OMAP4Video
For the most part, this is just adding "_t" suffixes to all the typedefs.
The OMAP4 controller registers are in "regs4.h" and OMAP3 in "regs3.h", they are selected between with a compile time switch - hence !MkROM becomes !Ms !MkRom3 and !MkRom4.
OMAP3 version tested & still works, OMAP4 will not work.

@Fix black screen on boot issue. Use C99 number types.
Detail:
  c/dss - Fixed the cause of the black screens on boot on OMAP3 machines (DM37xx seems fine). It looks like the cause was due to skipping the step where you disable the LCD output before triggering the DSS reset.
  c/cmodule, c/dispc, c/dss, c/graphicsv, h/globals - Removed code relating to previous attempts to fix the black screen issue
  c/cmodule, c/dispc, c/dsi, c/dss, c/graphicsv, c/palette, c/regs, c/sdma, c/venc, h/dsi, h/dss, h/globals, h/graphicsv, h/palette, h/regs - Use the C99 number types instead of u32, u16, etc.

@Assorted OMAPVideo tweaks and fixes
Detail:
  c/dispc - Added some WIP code for programming scaling coefficients
  c/dispc, c/graphicsv - Fixed code to not allow the graphics overlay to be enabled before its DMA address had been set (as was happening on boot)
  c/dispc - Enable reporting of FIFO underflow & OCPERROR interrupts in debug builds, to help track down bugs
  c/dispc - Check in some disabled code that was an attempt to fix the IGEP display problems. Code was to force FIFO preload values to 0x100, and to force DISPC_POL_FREQ to 0.
  c/dsi - Keep the DSI complex I/O clock off
  c/dsi, c/dss, h/dss, h/regs - rewrote calculate_dss_clock_divider to remove data lane frequency restriction, and to increase speed/accuracy when calculating rates for tricky values like 25.175MHz. Also in another attempt to fix the IGEP issues, it mimics the Linux driver by trying to generate a 48MHz DSI clock.
  c/dss, c/venc - Tweaked DSS reset & VENC code to make sure VENC clcoks are enabled & disabled at the appropriate times.
  c/graphicsv - Fix GraphicsV_SetDMAAddress so it works properly no matter what overlay the desktop is on
  c/venc - A fix to get the PAL test card working, and a fudge to get PAL output working.

  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard & IGEP.
  IGEP reported as showing no concrete improvement in display stability :(

@Add initial version of OMAP video driver module
Detail:
  All-new OMAP video driver, written as a module in C.
  Functionality-wise it's basically the same as the original HAL-based driver, except it provides support for GraphicsV_Render via use of the OMAP SDMA controller, and there's currently no support for GraphicsV_IICOp.
  However under the hood the module is significantly different, to ensure it can be expanded to expose the full feature set of the video controller once the new GraphicsV API is ready.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard.
