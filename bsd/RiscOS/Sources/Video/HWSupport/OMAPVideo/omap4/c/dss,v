@Big refactor, introduce GraphicsV overlay API support
Detail:
  This change introduces initial support for the GraphicsV overlay API.
  RGB & YUV overlays are supported, along with rotation and scaling.
  Vertical flipping isn't supported yet, and there are still a number of bugs to track down, along with some potential improvements.
  The code has also been refactored significantly, in an attempt to protect all critical state with spinlocks/mutexes (as appropriate), and to reduce the number of globals so that it's easier to see what's touching what. Previously very little locking was performed, which could lead to issues if VSyncs or synclost interrupts occurred during certain operations. Now, the data should be structured in such a way that this shouldn't cause problems.
  Notable things:
  * State which needs to be writable from interrupt handlers is protected by spinlocks
  * State which needs to be readable from interrupt handlers is protected by reader-writer spinlocks
  * State which doesn't need to be accessed from interrupt handlers is unprotected (mutexes can be introduced in the future to make the code SMP-safe)
  * Using non-alpha screen modes for the desktop will currently result in only "basic" overlays being supported (i.e. overlays which appear ontop of the desktop). In some cases this could be improved by falling back to a software pointer, but for now the only way to get Z-Order overlays is to use a screen mode with an alpha channel.
  * Memory allocation for overlays is abstracted via the buffer interface (h/buffer). This has three implementations: basic buffers for untransformed overlays, VRFB-transformed buffers for OMAP3, and TILER-transformed buffers for OMAP4.
  * Ultimately all overlay memory is allocated as physically contiguous pages within a PMP - although since TILER contains its own MMU this isn't strictly necessary on OMAP4
  * Overlay memory is mapped as write-through cacheable for CPU access; experimentation with different cache policies has yet to be performed. However a potential future optimisation would be to perform lazy unmapping of overlay buffers, reducing the map/unmap overhead in well-behaved code which only maps buffers when they're needed

	   required for the given pixel rate (in Hz)
	   Output values aren't guaranteed to be within range

	   The full clock flow is as follows:
	     DSI PLL input = DSI_PLL_REFCLK (= DSS2_ALWON_FCLK = sys_clk)
	     Data lane freq = DSIPHY = 2*pixel rate*DSI_BPP/DSI_LANES
	     DSIPHY = 2*DSI_PLL_REGM/(DSI_PLL_REGN+1)*DSI_PLL_REFCLK
	   Also, 0.5MHz <= Fint <= 2.5MHz where Fint = DSI_PLL_REFCLK/(DSI_PLL_REGN+1)
	   DSIPHY is then used as the source for the HSDIVIDER, which does the following:
	     DSIn_PCLK1 = DSIPHY/(REGM4+1)
	     DSIn_PCLK2 = DSIPHY/(REGM5+1)
	   Both must be <= 186MHz
	   DSIn_PCLK2 can be used to drive the DSI module, except we don't care much for that
	   DSIn_PCLK1 is what we use to drive the DISPC pixel clock:
	     pixel rate = (DSIn_PCLK1/LCD)/PCD
	     1 <= LCD <= 255
	     1 <= PCD <= 255
	   We aren't using the DSI output module, so we can ignore the data lane frequency
	   This increases the number of DSI PLL register combinations available, so to keep this
	   code simple we remove LCD and PCD from the equation by forcing them to their minimal
	   values. This also helps power usage a bit since DISPC will be clocked with the lowest
	   possible clock (for a given pixel rate).

  h/dss - Remove regmf field from clock_divider_t
  h/regs3 - Correct typo in OVERLAY_ATTRIBUTES register field
  h/regs4 - Rename many registers to match the name used in the OMAP4 TRM (previously used OMAP3 naming due to shared code being used for both chips). Fix the occasional mistake. Also removed configuration4 register from DSI PLL (not mentioned in recent TRMs)
  omap4/c/dispc_plat - Updated for new register names
  omap4/c/dsi - Remove setting of DSI PLL configuration4 register
  omap4/c/dss - Update for new register names. Removal of regm4 from clock_divider_t. Update FIFO configuration so that the larger WB FIFO is used instead of the GFX one.
  omap4/c/omap - Update for new register names and FIFO setup. Fix omap4_vetmode_ldc2() returning true for invalid widths instead of false.

@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.
