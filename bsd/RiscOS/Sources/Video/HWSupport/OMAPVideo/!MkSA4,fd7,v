1.1
log
@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.
Admin:
  Tested on BeagleBoard, PandaBoard
