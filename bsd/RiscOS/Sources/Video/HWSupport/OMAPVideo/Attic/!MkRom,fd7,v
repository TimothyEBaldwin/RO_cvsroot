@Merge of headers with OMAP4Video
For the most part, this is just adding "_t" suffixes to all the typedefs.
The OMAP4 controller registers are in "regs4.h" and OMAP3 in "regs3.h", they are selected between with a compile time switch - hence !MkROM becomes !Ms !MkRom3 and !MkRom4.
OMAP3 version tested & still works, OMAP4 will not work.

@Add initial version of OMAP video driver module
Detail:
  All-new OMAP video driver, written as a module in C.
  Functionality-wise it's basically the same as the original HAL-based driver, except it provides support for GraphicsV_Render via use of the OMAP SDMA controller, and there's currently no support for GraphicsV_IICOp.
  However under the hood the module is significantly different, to ensure it can be expanded to expose the full feature set of the video controller once the new GraphicsV API is ready.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard.
