@Big refactor, introduce GraphicsV overlay API support
Detail:
  This change introduces initial support for the GraphicsV overlay API.
  RGB & YUV overlays are supported, along with rotation and scaling.
  Vertical flipping isn't supported yet, and there are still a number of bugs to track down, along with some potential improvements.
  The code has also been refactored significantly, in an attempt to protect all critical state with spinlocks/mutexes (as appropriate), and to reduce the number of globals so that it's easier to see what's touching what. Previously very little locking was performed, which could lead to issues if VSyncs or synclost interrupts occurred during certain operations. Now, the data should be structured in such a way that this shouldn't cause problems.
  Notable things:
  * State which needs to be writable from interrupt handlers is protected by spinlocks
  * State which needs to be readable from interrupt handlers is protected by reader-writer spinlocks
  * State which doesn't need to be accessed from interrupt handlers is unprotected (mutexes can be introduced in the future to make the code SMP-safe)
  * Using non-alpha screen modes for the desktop will currently result in only "basic" overlays being supported (i.e. overlays which appear ontop of the desktop). In some cases this could be improved by falling back to a software pointer, but for now the only way to get Z-Order overlays is to use a screen mode with an alpha channel.
  * Memory allocation for overlays is abstracted via the buffer interface (h/buffer). This has three implementations: basic buffers for untransformed overlays, VRFB-transformed buffers for OMAP3, and TILER-transformed buffers for OMAP4.
  * Ultimately all overlay memory is allocated as physically contiguous pages within a PMP - although since TILER contains its own MMU this isn't strictly necessary on OMAP4
  * Overlay memory is mapped as write-through cacheable for CPU access; experimentation with different cache policies has yet to be performed. However a potential future optimisation would be to perform lazy unmapping of overlay buffers, reducing the map/unmap overhead in well-behaved code which only maps buffers when they're needed

@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.

@Improve TV-Out support. Fix pointer transparency after DSS reset. Other tweaks.
Detail:
  c/venc - Fixed corruption when PAL output was in use and the display reached the bottom two rows of the screen; the screen height was being calculated incorrectly from the VENC register settings. This was also causing the constant SYNCLOSTDIGITAL interrupts.
  c/dss - Mark the mouse pointer image as dirty inside dss_reset(), to ensure the transparency colour gets set to hardware the next time the pointer is updated
  Makefile, cmhg/modhead - Make module help string reflect which OMAP version the module is for
  c/venc, h/regs3 - Added revision ID registers to OMAP3 register blocks, to reduce the number of differences between the OMAP3 & OMAP4 versions. The revision ID registers do exist on OMAP3, they just weren't listed in the early TRM version the module was first created from. Also fixed layout of DSI registers on OMAP3.
Admin:
  OMAP3 version tested on rev A2 BB-xM
  OMAP4 version builds but untested

@Improve OMAPVideo power saving abilities and palette handling
Detail:
  Makefile, c/palette, h/palette, c/cmodule, c/dispc, c/graphicsv, h/globals - Rewrote palette handling code to support multiple different transformations on palettes, to adapt the palettes from the RISC OS formats to the DISPC formats. This means that palettes and the mouse cursor are now correctly R/B swapped for TV-out, RISC OS's gamma correction tables are now supported, and clever use of gamma tables allows 16bpp modes to be displayed correctly by mapping RISC OS's 555 format to the OMAP's 565 format (but there'll only be 4 blue bits instead of 5)
  c/cmodule, c/dispc, c/graphicsv, h/globals - Add support for the HAL's new display power controls, and implement GraphicsV_SetBlank. For fixed LCDs this will ignore the requested DPMS state and instead just turn the power/backlight off.
  h/sdma - Marked the functions as extern.

  c/graphicsv - When setting the mode from a VIDC list, add the border values to the porch values to take into account the hardware's inability to emulate VIDC's coloured border facility. Behaviour matches that of NVidia module.
  h/regs - Add definitions for SMS registers (for display rotation)

@Add initial version of OMAP video driver module
Detail:
  All-new OMAP video driver, written as a module in C.
  Functionality-wise it's basically the same as the original HAL-based driver, except it provides support for GraphicsV_Render via use of the OMAP SDMA controller, and there's currently no support for GraphicsV_IICOp.
  However under the hood the module is significantly different, to ensure it can be expanded to expose the full feature set of the video controller once the new GraphicsV API is ready.

  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard.
