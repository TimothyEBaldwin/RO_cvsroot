@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.

  Tested on BeagleBoard, PandaBoard

@Merge of OMAP3 and OMAP4 video driver sources.
With 85%+ shared code, tracking changes between these two modules was getting complicated, so now this single module will serve both OMAP3 targets and OMAP4.
At present, the differences are simply selected at compile time with a switch. This may make sense to further rationalise either with tidier macros or run time detection (since the HAL knows which controller is running).
Tested on OMAP3 in all 8 colour depths,
Tested by Willi Theiss on OMAP4.

@Merge of headers with OMAP4Video
For the most part, this is just adding "_t" suffixes to all the typedefs.
The OMAP4 controller registers are in "regs4.h" and OMAP3 in "regs3.h", they are selected between with a compile time switch - hence !MkROM becomes !Ms !MkRom3 and !MkRom4.
OMAP3 version tested & still works, OMAP4 will not work.
