@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.

  Tested on BeagleBoard, PandaBoard

@Improve TV-Out support. Fix pointer transparency after DSS reset. Other tweaks.
Detail:
  c/venc - Fixed corruption when PAL output was in use and the display reached the bottom two rows of the screen; the screen height was being calculated incorrectly from the VENC register settings. This was also causing the constant SYNCLOSTDIGITAL interrupts.
  c/dss - Mark the mouse pointer image as dirty inside dss_reset(), to ensure the transparency colour gets set to hardware the next time the pointer is updated
  Makefile, cmhg/modhead - Make module help string reflect which OMAP version the module is for
  c/venc, h/regs3 - Added revision ID registers to OMAP3 register blocks, to reduce the number of differences between the OMAP3 & OMAP4 versions. The revision ID registers do exist on OMAP3, they just weren't listed in the early TRM version the module was first created from. Also fixed layout of DSI registers on OMAP3.
Admin:
  OMAP3 version tested on rev A2 BB-xM
  OMAP4 version builds but untested

@Add initial version of OMAP video driver module
Detail:
  All-new OMAP video driver, written as a module in C.
  Functionality-wise it's basically the same as the original HAL-based driver, except it provides support for GraphicsV_Render via use of the OMAP SDMA controller, and there's currently no support for GraphicsV_IICOp.
  However under the hood the module is significantly different, to ensure it can be expanded to expose the full feature set of the video controller once the new GraphicsV API is ready.
Admin:
  Tested on rev C2 beagleboard.
