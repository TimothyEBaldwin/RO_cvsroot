@Big refactor, introduce GraphicsV overlay API support
Detail:
  This change introduces initial support for the GraphicsV overlay API.
  RGB & YUV overlays are supported, along with rotation and scaling.
  Vertical flipping isn't supported yet, and there are still a number of bugs to track down, along with some potential improvements.
  The code has also been refactored significantly, in an attempt to protect all critical state with spinlocks/mutexes (as appropriate), and to reduce the number of globals so that it's easier to see what's touching what. Previously very little locking was performed, which could lead to issues if VSyncs or synclost interrupts occurred during certain operations. Now, the data should be structured in such a way that this shouldn't cause problems.
  Notable things:
  * State which needs to be writable from interrupt handlers is protected by spinlocks
  * State which needs to be readable from interrupt handlers is protected by reader-writer spinlocks
  * State which doesn't need to be accessed from interrupt handlers is unprotected (mutexes can be introduced in the future to make the code SMP-safe)
  * Using non-alpha screen modes for the desktop will currently result in only "basic" overlays being supported (i.e. overlays which appear ontop of the desktop). In some cases this could be improved by falling back to a software pointer, but for now the only way to get Z-Order overlays is to use a screen mode with an alpha channel.
  * Memory allocation for overlays is abstracted via the buffer interface (h/buffer). This has three implementations: basic buffers for untransformed overlays, VRFB-transformed buffers for OMAP3, and TILER-transformed buffers for OMAP4.
  * Ultimately all overlay memory is allocated as physically contiguous pages within a PMP - although since TILER contains its own MMU this isn't strictly necessary on OMAP4
  * Overlay memory is mapped as write-through cacheable for CPU access; experimentation with different cache policies has yet to be performed. However a potential future optimisation would be to perform lazy unmapping of overlay buffers, reducing the map/unmap overhead in well-behaved code which only maps buffers when they're needed

	/* Calculate DSI_PLL_REGM, DSI_PLL_REGN, DSI_PLL_REGM3 (aka DSS_CLOCK_DIV) values required for the given pixel rate (in Hz)
	   Output values aren't guaranteed to be within range

	   The full clock flow is as follows:
	     DSI PLL input = DSI_PLL_REFCLK (= DSS2_ALWON_FCLK = sys_clk)
	     Data lane freq = DSIPHY = 2*pixel rate*DSI_BPP/DSI_LANES
	     DSIPHY = 2*DSI_PLL_REGM/(DSI_PLL_REGN+1)*DSI_PLL_REFCLK/(HIGHFREQ+1)
	     HIGHFREQ = (DSI_PLL_REFCLK>32MHz?1:0) (=0 for all current sys_clk values)
	   Also, 0.75MHz <= Fint <= 2.1MHz where Fint = DSI_PLL_REFCLK/(DSI_PLL_REGN+1)
	   DSIPHY is then used as the source for the HSDIVIDER, which does the following:
	     DSI1_PLL_FCLK = DSIPHY/REGM3
	     DSI2_PLL_FCLK = DSIPHY/REGM4
	   Both must be <= 173MHz
	   DSI2_PLL_FCLK can be used to drive the DSI module, except we don't care much for that
	   DSI1_PLL_FCLK is what we use to drive the DISPC pixel clock:
	     pixel rate = (DSI1_PLL_FCLK/LCD)/PCD
	     1 <= LCD <= 255
	     2 <= PCD <= 255
	   We aren't using the DSI output module, so we can ignore the data lane frequency
	   This increases the number of DSI PLL register combinations available, so to keep this code simple we remove LCD and PCD from the equation by forcing them to their minimal values.
	   This also helps power usage a bit since DISPC will be clocked with the lowest possible clock (for a given pixel rate). In the future we may need to change this (e.g. for video overlay
	   downscaling, or for more accurate generation of clocks like 25.175MHz - where LCD*PCD=5 allows accurate generation of 25.175MHz)

	   An algorithm that aims for 100% accurate clock rates was found to be incapable of calculating divider values for most RISC OS screen modes (in particular the 25.175MHz mode used at boot).
	   Instead, an algorithm that aims to find the closest possible clock rate is used. Most clock rate errors appear to be tiny (within 1kHz of the desired pixel rate), so these errors shouldn't pose any problems. */

@Add chip-specific functions for *VideoRegs and *TVRegs. Change some OMAP3 register names.
Detail:
  c/cmodule, h/globals, omap3/c/omap, omap4/c/omap - Get rid of all the ugly #if's in *VideoRegs handling by moving video & TV register dump logic into chip-specific functions (omap_dump_videoregs, omap_dump_tvregs).
  h/regs3, omap3/c/dispc_plat, omap3/c/dss, omap3/c/omap, omap3/c/venc - Remove '1' from DISPC control & config register names, was only present for OMAP4 compatibility.
  omap4/c/dsi - Fix debug compile error due to DSI PLL regmf removal

@Big code refactor
Detail:
  Support for different OMAP revisions has now been abstracted, with code specific to a certain OMAP revision now located in the omap3 and omap4 folders. This has resulted in some code duplication, but greater readability due to the removal of the #defines that were in use before. This new structure should also make it easier to implement new features, especially those only supported by certain OMAPs.
  Each platform provides a headattrs struct and an overlayattrs struct, which are the primary interface the core code uses to control the backend. Eventually it may be possible to produce one build of the module which supports multiple OMAP revisions at runtime, but for now some #defines and OMAP-specific code remains in the common files.
  This change also adds support for extra pixel formats, gamma table support for OMAP4, and fixes several bugs.
