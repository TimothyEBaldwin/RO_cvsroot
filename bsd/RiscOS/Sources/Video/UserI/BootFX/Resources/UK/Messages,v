1.2
log
@Major internal replumbing.

Detail:

Extended the SWI interface to cope with multiple clients using BootFX to plot
progress bars (as originally intended). This did mean making a non-backwards-
compatible change to the BarUpdate SWI call (should only affect BootCmds).

Also fixed some minor bugs.

Finally, added a specification to the Docs directory and an example program
to the Tests directory.

Admin:

Implies BootCmds 1.46later.
