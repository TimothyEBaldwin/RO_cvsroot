@Add a clone of ROL's BlendTable module
Detail:
  This is a clone of ROL's BlendTable module, based around the API documentation available on their website
  s/Module contains the main bulk of the code.
  Depending on the source & destination sprite/mode, the code will select from one of a handful of different table generation algorithms in order to get the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.
  Tables are cached internally in order to improve performance when repeatedly rendering with the same parameters. However unlike ColourTrans the cache has a maximum size, so performance will suffer if too many different tables are requested and table locking is not used.
Admin:
  Tested on BB-xM


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'BlendTable-0_01'
