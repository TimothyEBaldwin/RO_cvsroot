@32 bit compatible
Assembler tweaks for 32 bit mode, added module flags, used Push/Pull macros were appropriate.
Now uses registered module name, SWI base, and error block. Previously the SWI base clashed with a commercial module.
Lined up the module help nicely.
Get version number from VersionASM.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi (RISC OS 5.21) and Risc PC (RISC OS 4.02).

Version 1.02. Tagged as 'PsychoEffects-1_02'

PsychoEffect
============

Yes, sorry about the name but I‘ve got all star commands starting with Psycho
at the start registered to me (for Digital Psychosis and all that).  Anyway,
PsychoEffect is a 256 colour mode fader with dithering.  The details of its
SWI are at the top of the source file.  The files includes are

FadeSpr 	For reference, this is the fade data, created by eye, which
		the module uses. 

LinFade 	The data stripped out of FadeSpr.  This is INCBINed into
		the PsychoEffect Module at compile time.

FadeDemo 	You'll need a 256 colour MODE 15 sprite to run this.  The
		lizard file supplied with Translator is particularly good for
		this.

EffSource 	The source code for PsychoEffects.
