@Modify to allow inclusion in ROM builds
Detail:
  Makefile - Define ROM_MODULE when being built for ROM
  h/handler, s/handler_asm - Ensure abort handler stub is running from RAM (so it can use PC-relative LDR to get workspace values)
  c/cmodule - Disable ROM date check when running from ROM. Allow log configuration to fail when running from ROM.
  c/log - When running from ROM, wait until log configuration succeeds before outputing any logs

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of ZeroPain module
Detail:
  This is a compatibility/logging module designed to work with zero page
  relocation. It will trap any emulate LDR/LDRB/LDM which reads from the first
  16K of the logical address space. Attempts to access some known kernel
  workspace locations will cause the correct value to be returned, while all
  other locations will return zero. Whenever an instruction is trapped and
  emulated an entry will be added to a log file so that the user is aware of
  the issue.
