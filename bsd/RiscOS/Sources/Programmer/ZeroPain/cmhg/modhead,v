@Automatically disable the kernel's compatibility page
Detail:
  In order for ZeroPain to be useful for logging page zero accesses or emulating old zero page locations, it needs to be able to trap page zero reads. The new compatibility page introduced in Kernel-5_87 prevents this, so make sure the page is disabled whenever we're active.
  c/cmodule - Detect & disable the compatibility page on startup and on Service_PostInit (for when ZeroPain is in ROM). Re-enable the page on exit if necessary.
  c/handler_c - Emulate the same pattern that the kernel includes in the compatibility page for locations &0-&2f
  c/log, h/log - Root service call handler moved to c/module
  cmhg/modhead - Listen out for Service_PostInit

  Tested on BB-xM

@Initial import of ZeroPain module
Detail:
  This is a compatibility/logging module designed to work with zero page
  relocation. It will trap any emulate LDR/LDRB/LDM which reads from the first
  16K of the logical address space. Attempts to access some known kernel
  workspace locations will cause the correct value to be returned, while all
  other locations will return zero. Whenever an instruction is trapped and
  emulated an entry will be added to a log file so that the user is aware of
  the issue.
