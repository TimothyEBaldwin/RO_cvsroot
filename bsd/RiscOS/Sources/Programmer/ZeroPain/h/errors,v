@Initial import of ZeroPain module
Detail:
  This is a compatibility/logging module designed to work with zero page
  relocation. It will trap any emulate LDR/LDRB/LDM which reads from the first
  16K of the logical address space. Attempts to access some known kernel
  workspace locations will cause the correct value to be returned, while all
  other locations will return zero. Whenever an instruction is trapped and
  emulated an entry will be added to a log file so that the user is aware of
  the issue.
Admin:
  Tested on Iyonix with zero page relocation
