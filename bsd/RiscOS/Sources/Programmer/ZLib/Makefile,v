1.2
log
@Implement task association. Add proper error messages. Other tweaks.
Detail:
  Resources/UK/Messages - Messages file for error messages
  c/errors, h/errors - Error lookup/conversion code
  c/task, h/task - Task association code
  Makefile - Updated for new source files, messages file, and C version of assembler header
  c/cmodule, h/globals - Updated to generate proper errors and add task association support. Fixed SWI handler to work. Tweak implementation of Compress/Decompress SWIs.
  cmhg/modhead - Use exported value of SWI chunk instead of hardcoded value. Add service call veneer for Service_WimpCloseDown.
  hdr/ZLib - Export list of errors. Use exported value of SWI chunk instead of hardcoded value.
Admin:
  Tested in softload form
  Compress/Decompress SWIs, gzip SWIs, and task association all seem to work. Other SWIs untested.

log
@Add initial version of ZLib module
Detail:
  This is a clone of RISCOS Ltd's ZLib module, produced by reading the documentation available on their website
  At the moment the module is still in development, but once finished it should be functionaly equivalent to their module from the users perspective
  In reality the module is based around a newer version of zlib (1.2.5 + tweaks) than the version RISCOS Ltd are believed to be using (1.1.4 + double-free fix)
Admin:
  Compiles but entirely untested.
  Error messages need sorting out, and there are plenty of TODO's in the sources which will need sorting before the module can be put to use.
