1.1
log
@Implement task association. Add proper error messages. Other tweaks.
Detail:
  Resources/UK/Messages - Messages file for error messages
  c/errors, h/errors - Error lookup/conversion code
  c/task, h/task - Task association code
  Makefile - Updated for new source files, messages file, and C version of assembler header
  c/cmodule, h/globals - Updated to generate proper errors and add task association support. Fixed SWI handler to work. Tweak implementation of Compress/Decompress SWIs.
  cmhg/modhead - Use exported value of SWI chunk instead of hardcoded value. Add service call veneer for Service_WimpCloseDown.
  hdr/ZLib - Export list of errors. Use exported value of SWI chunk instead of hardcoded value.
Admin:
  Tested in softload form
  Compress/Decompress SWIs, gzip SWIs, and task association all seem to work. Other SWIs untested.
