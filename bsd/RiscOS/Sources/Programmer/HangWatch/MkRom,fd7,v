@Add HangWatch debugging module
Detail:
  HangWatch is a debugging module with a primary focus of acting as a watchdog process.
  Using a timer configured to generate FIQs, HangWatch monitors the system, and triggers a dump of debug data (registers, stacks, DADebug buffer) if the watchdog counter limit is hit
  A HangWatch_Dump SWI is also available, allowing a dump to be triggered manually if required.
Admin:
  Tested on OMAP3 & Raspberry Pi


Version 0.01. Tagged as 'HangWatch-0_01'
