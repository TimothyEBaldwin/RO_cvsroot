Convert the textual output from the 'diffrelease.pl' script into an HTML file
which is designed to be easier on the eye and handy to navigate out of. You can
click on links from within this report directly to an appropriate page in an
appropriate viewer service, such as cvsweb. It will also refer to an external
cascading style sheet.

Syntax: rel2html [-Help] [-Viewer <URI>] [-Css <URI>] -Title <text> <input text> <output html>

  <input text>  - name of the input file output by the diffrelease.pl script
  <output html> - name of the output file to create
  -title <text> - mandatory: document title string (must be HTML safe
  -viewer <URI> - optional: location of the viewer (e.g. '/viewer/view/')
  -css <URI>    - optional: location of the CSS file (e.g. '/css/risc_os_open.css')

Defaults:

  -viewer './viewer/'
  -css './styles.css'
